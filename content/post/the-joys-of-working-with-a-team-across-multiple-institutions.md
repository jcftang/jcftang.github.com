Having worked in a number of cross institutional projects in the past
has lead me to always be weary about how to interact with
people. Often it's the lack of co-ordination and communication that
seems to be the killer. Parts of the team would seem to not know what
other parts of the team are doing and thus either deviate from the
master plan or duplicate work.

Gathering requirements for a project is always fun, translating the
requirements for a developer to create the end product is even more
fun, it often can lead to 'chinese whispers' where things just get
miscommunicated and misunderstood.

Agreeing on collaborating in a sense that everyone should talk and
making sure everyone is on the same page always seems to be a touchy
subject, everyone is an expert. So many things can be resolved by just
bridging the communication gap. I will be finding this out very soon
in how I manage expectations for the latest project that I am working
on.

Perhaps I should change my approach vector in getting everyone to
communicate their concerns and specifications to deliver the product
that we want to create. The worst thing we can do is spend half our
time developing something based on an early spec only to find out that
the goal posts have changed.
