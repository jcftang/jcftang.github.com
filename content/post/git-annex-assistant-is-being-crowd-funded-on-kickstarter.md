It seems [Joey Hess](http://kitenet.net/~joey/) is in the process of
getting __git-annex assistant__ crowd funded. I had not been keeping
up to date too much in the last year with git-annex partly because it
met my needs and I never needed to upgrade to the latest tip.

There are a number of really cool features now which is making
git-annex more accessible. I particularly like how the merge and sync
workflows have now been pretty much _scripted_ so there is less to go
wrong!

Once the __Dropbox__ like features get implemented git-annex will be
pretty interesting, it won't be a complete _clone_ of Dropbox due to
the way that git-annex deals with files (using symlinks), it will be a
pretty good alternative to Dropbox. I wish _smudge filters_ were on
the roadmap as well.
