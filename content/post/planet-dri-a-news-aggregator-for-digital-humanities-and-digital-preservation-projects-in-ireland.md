This is just a temporary solution till something better or more
appropriate comes along. It's just an ikiwiki news aggregator for
websites and projects which are related to Digital Preservation,
Digitial Humanities and other related bits and pieces.

It was pretty much setup for myself to keep up to date with all the
latest happenings. I found myself falling behind in being
knowledgeable in all things related to _Digital Repositories Ireland_.

I hope that my team mates will appreciate and contribute to this
little effort. I don't think I've ever come across a Digital
Humanities and Digital Preservation aggregator before.
