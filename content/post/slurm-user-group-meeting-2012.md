This time the usergroup meeting is in BSC in Spain (this place is
cool, I've been at BSC for a few conferences and meetings before). I
wish I was doing some HPC right now, I'm very tempted to submit an
abstract or two on the last two things with slurm that I was involved
with.

The [php-slurm](https://github.com/jcftang/php-slurm) package needs
some love, its somewhat in use at work. I just wish I had more time to
fix the memory leaks. There is also
[slurm-bank](https://github.com/jcftang/slurm-bank) which is seeing
some good use in work, though it could do with a rewrite in C.
