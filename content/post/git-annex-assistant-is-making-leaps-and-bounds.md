I've been following the development of the new _git-annex assistant_
work that Joey Hess has been working on over the past few weeks. Even
in this early state of development, it is slowly becoming more usable
and accessible for less technical users.

As soon as as the
[issues with the limitations of _kqueue_ and OSX's silly limits](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Issue_on_OSX_with_some_system_limits/)
are resolved (without the need for a user to do a _sysctl -w
WHATEVER_) it will be pretty cool.

I've been throwing small batches of data at a newly setup _annex_'d
repository and it's been handling it well enough for me to constantly
test the various development branch. Kudos to Joey for being so
responsive to fixing bugs during development.

For those that care go to
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog/> and follow
the development of this cool tool
