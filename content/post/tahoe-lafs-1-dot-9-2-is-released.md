I've been happily using [tahoe-lafs](http://www.tahoe-lafs.org) for my
backup needs for a while now in work. It's not a huge cluster, but just
a small hive cache from workstations dotted around the lab.

The project recently did a release which fixes a number of bugs and
issues which has made this software much more pleasant to use. I've
also been happily using git-annex to manage my files which reside in
tahoe-lafs.

At somepoint I need to write a tahoe-lafs backend/remote for git-annex,
or at least convince the git-annex author to write one!
