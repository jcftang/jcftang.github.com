I only been here for a day and Edinburgh is as nice as I recall it
was. This time my attendance to Open Repositories 2012 brought me and
some co-workers of the DRI team to this city. It's my first time at
this event and there seems to be lots of people, so far it's been
pleasant enough apart from the weather.

For those interested in whats happening you should follow the hashtag
***#or2012*** on twitter to see what people are saying. One of the cool
thing was they gave out 8gb USB memory sticks (built into the name
cards), I thought that was a nice touch.

So far it's two thumbs up for the organisers. It's only workshops for
far, I look forward to the poster sessions and other talks which will
be on. Day 2 will be more workshops and poster sessions, plus a
keynote.
