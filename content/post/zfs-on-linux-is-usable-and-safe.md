It seems that ZFS On Linux reached a significant milestone, that is the
software is stable to use on Linux. This is pretty useful and significant
for the preservation and archivists community as it provides a more
reliable platform to build on. The LLNL guys must really want to mitigate
against silent data failures in their systems (they're running Lustre
on top of ZFS).

If ZFS is trustable or not we will know over time. At least with
ZFS's data protection features we will see less issues with silent
data corruption.

If one could build glusterfs or better yet, Ceph on top of ZFS it would
be pretty desirable.
