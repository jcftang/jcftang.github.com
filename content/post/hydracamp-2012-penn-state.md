What do you do when you need a crash course on RoR, Hydra and frameworks for
digital preservation and archiving? You go to Hydracamp!

The syllabus was

* Day 1 - Rails, CRUD, TDD and Git
* Day 2 - Collaborative development with Stories, Tickets, TDD and Git
* Day 3 - Hydra, Fedora, XML and RDF (ActiveFedora and OM)
* Day 4 - SOLR and Blacklight
* Day 5 - Hydra-head, Hydra Access Controls

Most of the training sessions were hands on from day 1 which was
refreshing, as it was hands on I getting the most out of the training
session. It would have been better if I had known more ruby to move
along some of the exercises more effectively.

To give an overview of what we had done (between ~30 people), we created
a ruby on rails application titled "Twitter for Zombies". With this small
application everybody was frantically committing, pulling, merging and
pushing code. It was highly informative and a good learning experience
to see how fast things could move.

The training session also included a crash course into what Fedora and
SOLR does and how Hydra interacts with these components. The third and
fourth days were the most interesting as it showed how someone might
convert from a typical RoR application into an application which uses
Fedora as the persistance layer. The last day was really just a wrap up
and Q&A session.

You could take a look at the [github](https://github.com/projecthydra)
account for Project Hydra and have a peek at the hydracamp repo.
