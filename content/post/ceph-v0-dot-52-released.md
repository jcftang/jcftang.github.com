The latest development branch of Ceph is out with some rather nice
looking features, what's probably the most useful are the RPM builds
for those that run RHEL6 like systems.

Still no real sight of backported kernel modules :P Also some of the
guys in work here just deployed a ~200tb Ceph installation which I've
access to a 10tb RBD for doing backups on.
