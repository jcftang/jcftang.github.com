I've just uploaded the work that Matthias and Quirijn did over the
past few months to the npm registry

* <http://search.npmjs.org/#/dri-api>
* <http://search.npmjs.org/#/dris-workflows>
* <http://search.npmjs.org/#/dri>
* <http://search.npmjs.org/#/fedora>

I haven't tried installing it from the npm repository yet, I assume
that they will work. There's still some cosmetic work (needs to be
branded correctly) that needs to be done as well as lots of error
checking, validation and testing. It's not a bad place to be starting
to look for ideas if you are interested in building your own system to
interface with Fedora Commons.

Just remember the above is just a prototype that we thought would be
good to share with the world!.
