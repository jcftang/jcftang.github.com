      <description>Having recently changed jobs (after a very long stint at TCD - just short of 10yrs!) I’ve moved to a small startup. I’ve been working on a few small bits and pieces of code, infrastructure, etc&amp;hellip; I had to make some stuff work and make it work well. So I decided to use autotools to configure and build the application that I’m working on.
As great as it was on my nice fast intel based machine, it was dog slow on my target platform, especially when I had to regenerate the autoconf scripts.</description>
