## Personal Blog

This is more of a technical blog of what I want to rant about
separate from my [personal blog](http://www.sgenomics.org/~jtang/).

## Resume

The following is an incomplete resume, it is work in progress.

## Research Interests

Parallel/distributed file systems, automated systems for software and
systems deployment, systems administration of large scale systems, SCM,
systems programming, beowulf cluster architecture, high performance
computing, numerical computing.

## Profile

Jimmy Tang is a senior software engineer in the TCHPC. He has
worked on a number of grid storage systems in the HPC Europa 1 and
2 programs developing management and storage solutions for numerical
computing. He has also participated in the development and deployment of
the infrastructures for the Irish African Partnership, 1641 Depositions,
IITAC, eINIS and a number of other projects.

He has extensive knowledge in the development, deployment and maintenance
of large scale storage and compute systems. He has in the past provided
software development and support services to numerous researchers,
research groups and projects in the area of High Performance Computing.

### Current Employment

#### Senior Software Engineer, Digital Repository Ireland, Trinity Centre for High Performance Computing.

Responsibilities include

* Overall architecture and design
* Leading a team of developers

### Past Employment

#### Research Assistant and Systems Administrator, Trinity Centre for High Performance Computing.

Responsibilities included

* Software developement for various researchers and users of the TCHPC
  facilities.
* Software development and administration on iRODS which is a part the
  HPC Europa 2 project. Development of workflows and microservices.
* Evaluation of various distributed and/or parallel filesystems suchas
  GPFS, Glusterfs,
* PVFS2, Lustre, Tahoe-lafs and Sector for possible future
  deployments.  Development and implementation of policies for
  allocating resources for accounting usage.
* Development of cports for automated software builds, documentation
  and environment con- figurations for end users.
* Package creation and administration for the software repositories
  that is used to deploy and maintain the compute clusters. Automation
  of installation processes of compute nodes. Building the software
  stacks from source. Writing .rpm and .deb packages for automated
  software deployment.
* Development and deployment of various medium sized clusters such as
  Kelvin, Parsons, Lonsdale and the tools for administering computer
  systems.
* Administation of the virtualised machines and floor wide network
  services for the different research groups from neuroscience,
  chemistry, physics, genetics, biochemistry and maths.

Notable responsibilities

* Deployment of Irish African Partnership services which included the
  setup of DSPACE, OracleDB, Oracle Application Server, LDAP and
  Handle.net. This project involved taking the existing college RSS
  and TARA systems and working with a small team to deploy a working
  system as a demonstrator for the Irish African Partnership. Lead TCD
  academic for this project was Prof. Jane Grimson.
* Evaluation of QCDGrid and SRB, deployment of data grid for HPC
  Europa for research and as a networking activity.
* GPFS administration for our compute clusters which was one of the
  largest ipoib enabled GPFS installations at the time of the
  installation of IITAC 2.0.
* Systems administration on the Bluegene/P, IITAC (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0),
  Lonsdale and parsons compute clusters.
