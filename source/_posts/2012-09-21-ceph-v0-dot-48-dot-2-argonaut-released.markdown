There's a new stable release of Ceph Argonaut, I seem to be having better
luck with playing with the development releases of Ceph.

Oh how I wish that there was a backport of the kernel ceph and rbd drivers
for RHEL6, I have a dodgy repo and some reverted commits that one of
the guys in work told me about. It seems to run but it isn't great,
it can be found at <https://github.com/jcftang/ceph-client-standalone>.
