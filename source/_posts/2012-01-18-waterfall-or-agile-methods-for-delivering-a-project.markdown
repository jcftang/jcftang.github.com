Waterfall methods seem to work well for smallish projects that are
well defined and well understood. At least from my own experiences of
putting things together, but realistically to think of all possible
scenarios and to write up all the possible solutions to the problem
seems a little bit wacky. To also assume that the requirements process
has captured requirements that won't change close the end of the
project is also a little unreasonable or unrealistic, this would be
especially true on a project that is planned to run for a few years
with fairly substantial goals in an ever changing research and
development environment.

Waterfall styled methods just cause problems with planning and
adjusting the process to the needs of the stakeholder (no matter what
the stakeholder thinks they need, they will change their mind). Again
this is especially true for long running projects.

So why not use agile methods? Simply because there is little or no
plan and it requires real collaboration, delegation of tasks and
trust to work towards a common goal. People get afraid perhaps?

The trick is communication and trying to introduce agile methods
slowly and steadily into the system. I've been slowly introducing the
idea of pairings, sprints and elements of scrum with kanban (yes,
that's lots of buzz words there already). Getting people to agree to
talk is probably the hardest thing to do, and it's even harder to try
and get everyone on the same page without ego's getting in the way.

It's paying off a little for now, the team members are beginning to at
least talk and exchange ideas. In my world that is a huge step
already. Next is it try getting things done by prioritising tasks and
resources.
