In the past few months, in my spare time whenever I get a chance, I've
been working on a side project in work. It's a research project
amongst a group of people with a cool idea. The idea is to apply
neural networks to identifying diseases, populations and traits via
machine learning/supervised learning. I'm not entirely sure about the
application of the technology as to how new or revolutionary it is,
but it seems sensible that a machine is going to be very good at being
taught how to recognise patterns so why not do it.

I'm not directly responsible for the code for this paper, but I did go
back and refactor most of the code in an attempt to make it a little
presentable to the world and also much faster as a result. I hope that
the source code will eventually see the light of day.

Note, I am not the primary author of this presentation/paper, I just
have an interest in the idea, code and enjoy learning and playing with
this research.

There will be a presentation at
[EMGM](http://www.genepi.med.uni-goettingen.de/download/EMGM2012_Preliminary_Programme.pdf),
I will be curious as to what people think. Is it a crazy good or a
crazy bad idea? The data that is being generated is apparently good,
though personally I would like to see more analysis being done with
additional ANN's or SVM's to verify that it really is working as
expected.

I wonder if I can convince a CS or a Maths summer student to
re-implement the algorithm with a different ANN or SVM library. There
are a rake of ideas that I have that I wouldn't mind seeing
implemented. I just need more time!
