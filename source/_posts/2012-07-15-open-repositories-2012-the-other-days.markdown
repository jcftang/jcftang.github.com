I finally had gotten back from the conference late in the evening on
Friday, airport security was not fun at all. It was the first Open
Repositories conference that I had attended, the community seems to be
pretty tightly knit. There were two or three software stacks which
were presented that looked useful.  Things such as Fedora-Commons,
Hydra and a few other sub-components which were talked about are going
to be likely building blocks that we will be using for our Digital
Repository.

There was also a developer challenge which I decided to enter at the
last minute, it was both a new and interesting experience at
presenting something that wasn't well prepared to an audience that I
had no experience with either. By the way, I was a team of one! I had
proposed the idea that replicating data can be expensive and bad,
there are alternatives to just copying files around en-mass and
storing replicas left right and centre.

I promised I would post some photos, but it seems my photos aren't as
interesting as the ones that other people took.

Next year Open Repositories will be held in Prince Edward Island,
Canada. I will need to be better prepared next year (assuming I go).
