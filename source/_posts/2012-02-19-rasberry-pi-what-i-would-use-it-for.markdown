At the time of writing it seems that the Raspberry Pi site is down,
probably suffering from a slashdot effect. I would imagine almost
every nerd, sheevaplug developer, OLPC developer, DIY'ers who want to
build their own home media centres are looking to get a Raspberry Pi
right now.

So what would I use one of these mini-computers for? I can think up a
range of cool applications for this device, assuming I can order a few
of these to play with. I've got ideas such as:

* A Tahoe-LAFS storage node, I could attach a few HDD's to one of these
  devices and run Tahoe-LAFS on it, these computers are cheap enough
  and have a low enough power consumption that I could just have them
  on all the time.  
* A Babeld node, I could have a few of these devices dotted around my
  house/apartment to build a mesh network.
* A portable computer, not quite a tablet PC with a screen, but it has
  enough connectivity to wire it up to a modern monitor or a TV.
* A penetration testing device, just wire it up with a few DC
  batteries, plug in a wireless card, wrap it up in a water proof
  package. Power on, and see how far you can throw it at your target,
  I can see endless possibilities for this device for pen-testing.

I wonder if the device will ever be able to be powered via the USB
port or the the ethernet port. I can see some interesting uses for
this device in data centres for monitoring the network, power
consumption and a host of other things.
