I've been eyeing this Ceph storage system for a while for a number of
potential uses, it looks like its finally ready for production usage.

It is a pitty that the cephfs component isn't recommended for
production usage yet. Still, Ceph is really going to shake up the
distributed storage industry. Having used GPFS, Lustre and a few other
systems in production in the past, Ceph certainly looks attractive.
