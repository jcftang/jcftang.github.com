There's a new release of Ceph, I hope that they release a stable soon so we can
do further evaluations of the Ceph storage
system. A few of my work colleagues are going to the [Ceph
workshop](http://www.inktank.com/news-events/event/ceph-workshops-amsterdam/)
next week.

I'm wondering if anyone has taken the CRUSH algorithm and used it in other
domains.
