The 12th DCC regional roadshow will take place on 6th and 7th June at
the McClay library, Queen's University Belfast.

The roadshow is being organised in conjunction with Queen's University
Belfast.

Turns out to be far more informative than I originally thought. Lot's
of real life examples of what people are doing and what's
relavent. It's not the usual workshop, conference or meeting that I
would attend.
