After a few months of budgeting, negotiations and finding venues we've
at Trinity College Dublin have committed to hosting a HydraCamp for
europe! So I'm shamelessly plugging it here.

Trinity College Dublin as a part of Digital Repository of Ireland will
be organising Hydra Camp in the week of April 8th till 12th, 2013. This
will be a week long training course, which will be aimed at developers
who are interested in the Hydra framework for developing repositories.

For those that don't know Hydra is a framework built upon various
Fedora-Commons, Apache SOLR, Ruby and Ruby on Rails technologies. At
DRI we're using it to build up our prototype repository.

It's possible to use the Hydra framework to build repositories for
archiving and preservation.
