I was recently at SC13 and attended a number of Python HPC tutorials,
Data Management and HPC systems engineering and administration BOF's.

This year's SC13 much calmer than previous years, but I did pick up a
few new tools during the conference. However I was pretty surprised that
there is a real lack of devops, sysadmins etc... in the this space.

I was also surprised at how things like salt and ansible are being
adopted in this space.
