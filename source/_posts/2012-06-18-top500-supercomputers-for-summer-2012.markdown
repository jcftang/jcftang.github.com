The Top 500 List is out! It's been no surprise that LLNL and IBM has
reclaimed the top spot. There is some pretty cool tech that's going to
come out of these systems which the HPC community should be rubbing
their hands over.

[Slurm](http://www.schedmd.com) will be moving along development for
these big systems as well as [Lustre](http://www.whamcloud.com) and
[zfs on linux](http://zfsonlinux.org/).
