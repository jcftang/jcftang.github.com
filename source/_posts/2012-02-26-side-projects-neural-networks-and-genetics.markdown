In the past few months, in my spare time whenever I get a chance, I've
been working on a side project in work. It's a research project
amongst a group of people with a cool idea. The idea is to apply
neural networks to identifying diseases, populations and traits via
machine learning. I'm not entirely sure about the application of the
technology as to how new or revolutionary it is, but it seems sensible
that a machine is going to be very good at being taught how to
recognise patterns so why not do it.
