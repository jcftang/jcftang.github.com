I feel lucky and living on the edge and I've recently decided to take
a preview of the 2.1 branch of octopress. So far Octopress has been
pretty good, it's been a refreshing change to the usual ikiwiki system
that I prefer. This experiment has worked out not too bad for me given
how much I like ikiwiki for most of if not all of my other little
websites and documentation sites.

It's not quite there yet, there a few theme issues which are probably
to be fixed. At least if I adopt it now there will be less conflicts
for me to resolve later on. Out of all the features that 2.1 will
bring that I like the most is the linklog feature. I've been using the
linklog feature for a few months now and it works pretty well.
