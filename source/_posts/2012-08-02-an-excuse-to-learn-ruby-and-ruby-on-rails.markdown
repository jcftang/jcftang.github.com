I've been a long time consumer of ruby applications but never quite
got around to learning the language and the frameworks that are
available to developers. Within the team that I have been working
with, we've been evaluating [hydra](http://projecthydra.org) as a
possible framework for our project.

I've been spending the last few days reading
[The RSpec Book](http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book), I've
been able to pick up some of the basic syntax of the language from the
BDD book. As soon as I finish this book I will be moving on to a more
real world book relating to ruby with the goal of being able to
develop Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.
