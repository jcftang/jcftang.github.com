Team meetings can be both productive and counter productive as most
people find. If they are well structured with a purpose and goal then
a lot can be achieved (most of the time).

For explorartory meetings, it's probably okay to have some time set
aside for some free and open discussions. Once a goal has been agreed
upon, it's probably a good idea to focus on it more and steer the
discussion to try and deliver on the goal. Having open ended
discussions with no set goals sometimes is discouraging and sometimes
a waste of time.

To the point, I wanted to discuss some things not to say and do in a
meeting which might cause a collapse in communications, these are just
some things that I have noticed in the last few months worth of
meetings and are based on my own experiences,

* Don't assume you know everything, there will always be someone
  smarter than you. There's nothing wrong with being an expert in your
  own area, but there are times where you just need to trust others to
  deliver.
* Don't pick on other team members for (possibly) not delivering, this
  is hugely demoralising. It's better to ask why, and if possible does
  that team member or members need help to deliver.
* In real life, does anyone really use waterfall methods to deliver a
  project?
* Don't try and do micro-management if you are clearly middle or even
  senior management, but at least describe tasks in the same language
  as the stakeholder and developer so that things don't get lost in
  translation.
* Do have a plan if the series of meetings are to last a few months if
  there are long term goals to be achieved. If it's not a plan, then
  at least have a list of todo, work in progress and done tasks.
* Don't assign tasks without deadlines (realistic ones).
* Don't assume you are on the same page in discussions unless you are
  confident that everyone at the meeting has common language and
  understands what is being discussed. People come and go, so you just
  have to be aware.

Most if not all of the above list of things is common sense, there
isn't anything too special that you need to do to succeed at
communicating.
