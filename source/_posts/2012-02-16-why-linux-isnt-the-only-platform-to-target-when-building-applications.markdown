Why would one want to target other platforms when building applications
on the server side? 

This came out of a conversation with the ex CTO of Creme software (he
is also a friend of mine). The conversation started out with why I like
to use Macs and OSX as my laptop or workstation. I've been a long time
Linux user of pretty much most of the major distributions ranging from
RHEL, Debian/Ubuntu, Gentoo, ArchLinux as well as a number of other
derivatives. Not to mention other systems like the BSD's which I have
a soft spot for. Some of the things that didn't like with the Linux's were
that not all my hardware would be supported all the time, the distro's
sometimes think that it's a good idea to completely change how lowlevel
systems work in favour of _what's hot right now_, sometimes the lack
of long term support for security updates (not package updates to fix
security problems) does make it more difficult to plan and deploy.

Of course there are things that I like, the access to the source code
and packaging to fix and redeploy packages.
