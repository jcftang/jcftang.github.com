This is more of a technical blog of what I want to rant about
separate from my [personal blog](http://www.sgenomics.org/~jtang/).

I currently work at http://www.tchpc.tcd.ie/ as a software
engineer for NAVR based in a high performance computing centre
(where I used to be a systems admin and research assistant). These
days I'm doing less sysadmin work and more of the other fun things,
like supposed research and development of stuff.
