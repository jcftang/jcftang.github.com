<div class="entry-content"><p>I feel lucky and living on the edge and I&#8217;ve recently decided to take
a preview of the 2.1 branch of octopress. So far Octopress has been
pretty good, it&#8217;s been a refreshing change to the usual ikiwiki system
that I prefer. This experiment has worked out not too bad for me given
how much I like ikiwiki for most of if not all of my other little
websites and documentation sites.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not quite there yet, there a few theme issues which are probably
to be fixed. At least if I adopt it now there will be less conflicts
for me to resolve later on. Out of all the features that 2.1 will
bring that I like the most is the linklog feature. I&#8217;ve been using the
linklog feature for a few months now and it works pretty well.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I was waiting for my backups to be done hence this post, as I was using
<em>git-annex</em> to manage my files and I decided I needed to have
git-annex on a SL5 based machine. SL5 is just an opensource
clone/recompile of RHEL5.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tried to install the newer versions of Haskell Platform and
GHC in a while on SL5 to instal git-annex. But the last time I checked
when GHC7 was out, it was a pain to install GHC on SL5.</p>

<p>However I have discovered that someone has gone through the trouble of
packaging up GHC and Haskell Platform for RHEL based distros.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://justhub.org/download">http://justhub.org/download</a> - Packaged GHC and Haskell Platform
RPM&#8217;s for RHEL based systems.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m primarily interested in installing <em>git-annex</em> on SL5 based
systems. The installation process goes as such&#8230;</p>

<p>First install GHC and Haskell Platform (you need root for these
following steps)</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://sherkin.justhub.org/el5/RPMS/x86_64/justhub-release-2.0-4.0.el5.x86_64.rpm
$ rpm -ivh justhub-release-2.0-4.0.el5.x86_64.rpm
$ yum install haskell
</code></pre>

<p>The RPM&#8217;s don&#8217;t place the files in /usr/bin, so you must add the
following to your .bashrc (from here on you don&#8217;t need root if you
don&#8217;t want things to be system wide)</p>

<pre><code>$ export PATH=/usr/hs/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>On SL5 pcre is at version 6.6 which is far too old for one of the
dependancies that git-annex requires. Therefore the user must install
an updated version of <em>pcre</em> either from source or another method, I
chose to install it from source and by hand into /usr/local</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/pcre/8.30/pcre-8.30.tar.gz/download
$ tar zxvf pcre-8.30.tar.gz
$ cd pcre-8.30
$ ./configure
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<p>Once the packages are installed and are in your execution path, using
cabal to configure and build git-annex just makes life easier, it
should install all the needed dependancies.</p>

<pre><code>$ cabal update
$ cabal install pcre-light --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/include
$ git clone git://git.kitenet.net/git-annex
$ cd git-annex
$ make git-annex.1
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you want to install it globallly for everyone (otherwise it will
get installed into $HOME/.cabal/bin)</p>

<pre><code>$ cabal install --global
</code></pre>

<p>The above will take a while to compile and install the needed
dependancies. I would suggest any user who does should run the tests
that comes with git-annex to make sure everything is functioning as
expected.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s possible to get git-annex as a back-end driver for
some of the digital preservation systems out there. Or more
interestingly can fedora-commons be used a special remote or back-end
for git-annex.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance or need to install git-annex on a SL6 based
system yet, but I would assume something similar to the above steps
would be required to do so.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just uploaded the work that Matthias and Quirijn did over the
past few months to the npm registry</p>

</ul>


<p>I haven&#8217;t tried installing it from the npm repository yet, I assume
that they will work. There&#8217;s still some cosmetic work (needs to be
branded correctly) that needs to be done as well as lots of error
checking, validation and testing. It&#8217;s not a bad place to be starting
to look for ideas if you are interested in building your own system to
interface with Fedora Commons.</p>

<p>Just remember the above is just a prototype that we thought would be
good to share with the world!.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The event was actually on 2012-06-06 and it was invite only. The event
was mostly about the infrastructure of Facebook. It was actually done
quite tastefully with a main speaker giving an overview of the whole
system. Luckily they did not turn the event into a recruitment event
which was quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the posters that I had actually want to see and
chat to the engineers involved wasn&#8217;t there, there were enough
engineers around for me to harass with questions.</p>

<p>This event was also the first event that I have been to in Dublin
which required an NDA, that was sort of strange. Some people that I
know didn&#8217;t attend as a result of the NDA.</p>

<p>All in all Facebook does have some pretty cool tech internally (like
all the other big dotcom companies). Some of it is even opensource!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a> is in the process of
getting <strong>git-annex assistant</strong> crowd funded. I had not been keeping
up to date too much in the last year with git-annex partly because it
met my needs and I never needed to upgrade to the latest tip.</p>

<p>There are a number of really cool features now which is making
git-annex more accessible. I particularly like how the merge and sync
workflows have now been pretty much <em>scripted</em> so there is less to go
wrong!</p>

<p>Once the <strong>Dropbox</strong> like features get implemented git-annex will be
pretty interesting, it won&#8217;t be a complete <em>clone</em> of Dropbox due to
the way that git-annex deals with files (using symlinks), it will be a
pretty good alternative to Dropbox. I wish <em>smudge filters</em> were on
the roadmap as well.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After almost 3 months supervising and working with two interns I&#8217;ve
finally uploaded their work under the GPLv2 License.</p>

</ul>


<p>Please note that the packages above do not represent DRI at all, they
just ended up getting labelled that way for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So what are the above packages? Well they are an attempt at creating a
workflow for the DRIS team in TCD who work on digital preservation,
digitisation, cataloging and a host of other tasks which I probably
don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>The prototype system consists of the DRIS Workflows package and the
API server. The system currently target the problem of ingesting
objects. It tries to map what the librarians/archivists at TCD are
doing to a single interface to increase throughput and quality of the
work (amongst other things).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also able to export the internal meta-data as Dublin-Core, it&#8217;s
not great right now and requires more work and there is a small start
made on MODS as well. It does demonstrate what the interns managed to
achieve in 3 months time with a loose spec on what needed to be
done. The basic design and architecture of the system isn&#8217;t too
different from Hydra, it was very much by accident that we ended up
some similar ideas.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this post is to share the code! and as per
usual, hope someone finds it useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on <em>ceph</em> for quite sometime now. It looks
like <em>ceph</em> is almost ready for production usage. There is now a
support infrastructure and a commercial company backing the
product. So far the OSD, MDS and MON components all run on Linux since
most of the implementation appears to be in the user land I wonder if
it will be ported to non-linux platforms. It&#8217;s be quite nifty if one
could have a heterogeneous network of servers providing storage.</p>

<p>From first glance at shadowing one of the guys in work with this
filesystem, it looks good. It&#8217;s missing some documentation right now
apart from that it&#8217;s going to be a great competitor in the distributed
filesystems arena. It will shake up GPFS and Lustre for sure, it might
even give glusterfs a run for its money in the near future.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In the world of digital preservation and repositories it seems that
there is primarily fedora-commons, dspace, eprints and one or two
other solutions out there for building up digital preservation
systems. The one that really stands out as a framework and toolkit for
building bigger and more complex systems is fedora-commons.</p>

<p>It also happens to be written in JAVA and is a fairly big and complex
system which implements best-practices for storing digital objects
with the sole purpose of preservation. In one of the projects that I
have been working with some interns at work; we have treated
fedora-commons as just storage system where we interface to the
preservation repository via the available REST api.</p>

<p>By using the API it was possible to use node.js to implement the
servers which contained all the business logic. Project Hydra does
something similar or rather we are doing something similar to Project
Hydra, by accident much to my suprise. Hydra uses Ruby on Rails for
its middleware implementation, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much JAVA
there either.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that this decoupled approach with REST servers and
clients to be pretty attractive to anyone who wishes to implement
these types systems. It is interesting to see that the applications
aren&#8217;t being written in JAVA. At least that is what I can see with the
projects that use Hydra (which is sort of the point). Maybe good
enough practice is fine for most use cases.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how many digital preservation projects out there
really use 100% JAVA up to delivery to the client? How many projects
out there are really just mashups of different types of technology
(well planned mashups). Is it because of &#8220;best practice&#8221; for
implementing enterprise applications that JAVA gets so much focus and
attention?</p>
