<div class="entry-content"><p>Having recently changed jobs (after a very long stint at TCD - just
short of 10yrs!) I’ve moved to a small startup. I’ve been working
on a few small bits and pieces of code, infrastructure, etc&hellip; I
had to make some stuff work and make it work well. So I decided to
use autotools to configure and build the application that I’m working
on.</p>

<p>As great as it was on my nice fast intel based machine, it was dog
slow on my target platform, especially when I had to regenerate the
autoconf scripts.</p>

<p>To get to the point, I ended up spending a day or two checking out
alternatives (that wasn’t cmake) and came across
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/waf/">waf</a>, the documentation isn’t all
that great if you just look at the website, I had to spend a few
hours digging around to get what I wanted.</p>

<p>Once I ported my application over to using waf, the configure and
build process was an order of magnitude faster than autotools. This
made a huge difference on my target platform. I noticed that waf
ships with some experimental plugins like the daemon plugin which
runs a build when it notices that somefiles have changed.</p>

<p>This daemon plugin is <em>great</em> it gives waf similar behaviour to
what java developers have with junit and eclipse. I’m finding that
waf is making me happy when I develop and fix stuff in the application
that I’m working on.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve been happily hacking at some packages for
<a href="https://hashdist.github.com">hashdist</a>, it&#39;s pretty nice, there
other build systems out there for dealing with building applications
and libraries with different combinations of compilers and numerical
libraries. Out of the lot I think hashdist has been the most satisfying
to use so far. It&#39;s still missing some bits and pieces to allow users
to use different compilers for key components (or everything).</p>

<p>Without explaining too much, it&#39;s basically taking inputs which define
a package and then generating an output hash to store the output of the
build. This means that as you modify the the environment and rebuild, it
will install the updated packages into a different location. Traditionally
I would have just overwritten the old versions or install it into a named
directory, then setup a module file for it etc&hellip; with hashdist there
is less messing around. It doesn&#39;t fully solve the problem of having
multiple versions of the software available at any one point in time,
but it does let you have many versions installed and you can create
different inputs profiles to get access to the &#39;builds&#39;. This means you
can version control your environment, it also means you can roll back
to a previous environment if something is broken or wrong.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We recently had Hydra Camp in Dublin in Trinity College Dublin which
went pretty well. I even got to talk a little about what we&#39;re doing
with Shibboleth and how we&#39;re deploying our systems.</p>

<p>We&#39;re deploy with ansible either by someone running the playbook by hand
or via buildbot which pushes out a build when tests pass successfully
on the master branch.</p>

<p>Someone in the camp asked at what complexity should you begin to automate
at, which I thought was a strange question since at DRI/TCD we thought
of deploying as automatically as possible from day 1.</p>

<p>My response to the question of when to automate was to automate it if you
know that you need documentation or know that there might be a second
time in setting up the system. Which pretty meant that we automate as
much as we can.</p>

<p>Automating means you at least have a script as documentation and as people
leave/join the project you have a chance of figuring out whats going
on. This is especially useful when you have a CI or CD styled system.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After going to SC13 and being at a few BoF&#39;s and hearing
some people talk about their operations and potentially using
<a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a> to replace the likes of puppet and chef,
I decided to learn a little more about Salt.</p>

<p>In particular since I have an old laptop lying around at
home, I decided to setup a little private cloud. I followed this <a href="http://www.saltstack.com/salt-blog/2013/11/19/cloud-making-doesnt-have-to-be-so-hard-salt-virt-tutorial">blog
post</a>.</p>

<p>It mostly worked apart from some buggy behaviour in the seeding
process. It was certainly lower overhead in setting a salt managed
&#39;cloud&#39; than setting up a full on <a href="http://opennebula.org/">Open Nebula</a>
instance or even openstack.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty neat that a provisioned VM reports into the salt master
and is ready to be provisioned pretty quickly when it boots up. I can
certainly see the attraction of using Salt to setup a private cloud with
Salt as the controller.</p>

<p>In short compared to <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/">Ansible</a> Salt is a
bit more heavy weight than Ansible. I haven&#39;t done any like with like
comparisons but I do feel that Salt seems like the better option for
maintaining long running systems and Ansible is great for rapid redeploys
of systems (from a clean state)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve uploaded the configs that I have been using at home to github, they
can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcftang/salt-virt">here</a>, there&#39;s even a
few packer templates to build base images for CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

Data Management and HPC systems engineering and administration BOF&#39;s.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s SC13 much calmer than previous years, but I did pick up a
few new tools during the conference. However I was pretty surprised that
there is a real lack of devops, sysadmins etc&hellip; in the this space.</p>

<p>I was also surprised at how things like salt and ansible are being

<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#39;s probably no secret that we use Ansible at our work place for
the project that I am working on. So far we&#39;ve used it to deploy and
maintain state for our Open Nebula deployment, Jenkins CI system, Ceph&#39;s
radosgw and our digital repository.</p>

<p>In fact I currently have a Jenkins job which deploys our software stack
using Ansible to a test system in our Open Nebula cluster. This has been
hugely beneficial to myself so far to be able to teardown and bring up
systems quickly to make sure our application is well tested and debugged.</p>

<p>Without going into a huge amount of detail, we&#39;ve been able to deploy our
systems with relative ease and repeatability. I&#39;ve got the configurations
up at my github account for those that are interested.</p>

<p>The best thing about these deployments is that the initial prototyping
was done in a set of vagrant managed virtual machines, this allowed me
to rapidly bring up and teardown systems to ensure we have everything
automated smoothly. On the flipside, the systems that get developed for
production usage get backported to our vagrant setup. This means that
we&#39;re able to provide a development environment for each developer which
is identical or as close as possible to our production systems.</p>

<p>Having the capability to develop and test on a local machine which is
close to or identical to our production system has accelerated our bug
finding and development process.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not too sure what the team think, since we&#39;re moving quite fast and
Ansible has allowed us to do so due to its ease of use, well it has at
least let me do so anyway.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The team that I am working with right are very much agile and we&#39;re
doing quite a bit of outside in development of the repository that we&#39;re
building. We&#39;re mostly adopting a behaviour driven development with a
touch of test driven development. As a result we&#39;re very much in favour
of testing things out as much as we can and using the same environments
to develop against. As previously mentioned before I had originally
been using puppet and vagrant to build up the development harness and
experiment with tools/services that we might want to use for our system.</p>

<p>At somepoint I came across <a href="http://www.ansible.cc">ansible</a> and not long
after discovering it, I migrated a large chunk of the development and
test systems to using ansible. I&#39;ve even cooked up one or two ansible
modules as a result.</p>

<p>As a result of adopting ansible for building up our test and development
infrastructure, I&#39;ve collected the relevant playbooks and roles that a
person might want for deploying all the bits and pieces needed to roll
out a hydra-head. See <a href="https://github.com/jcftang/ansible-hydra">https://github.com/jcftang/ansible-hydra</a>, I have
a set of roles and a few example playbooks on setting up at least</p>

<ul>
<li>Tomcat (from the base repositories of RHEL6/Centos6/ScientificLinux6)</li>
<li>Fedora-Commons (the same version as is in the hydra-jetty repo)</li>
<li>Apache SOLR (the same version as is in the hydra-jetty repo)</li>
<li>Ruby (via RVM) in a user directory</li>
<li>Passenger with the installed version of Ruby</li>
<li>MySQL (from the base repositories of RHEL6/Centos6/ScientificLinux6)</li>
<li>Redis</li>
</ul>

<p>The configurations aren&#39;t quite production ready yet as they do require
some more work in setting up Fedora-Commons and SOLR the way we want. The
configurations are however fairly realistic and are daily use
for doing test deployments of our hydra-head (RoR application) or
experimenting with additional tools, configurations and systems such as
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/ansible-ceph">ceph</a> - we&#39;re using the radosgw
to provide a realistic and local S3 service.</p>

<p>So far the configurations need polishing off and another playbook needs
to be created for continuous deployment of our hydra-head.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that ZFS On Linux reached a significant milestone, that is the
software is stable to use on Linux. This is pretty useful and significant
for the preservation and archivists community as it provides a more
reliable platform to build on. The LLNL guys must really want to mitigate
against silent data failures in their systems (they&#39;re running Lustre
on top of ZFS).</p>

<p>If ZFS is trustable or not we will know over time. At least with
ZFS&#39;s data protection features we will see less issues with silent
data corruption.</p>

<p>If one could build glusterfs or better yet, Ceph on top of ZFS it would
be pretty desirable.</p>
