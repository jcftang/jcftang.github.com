<div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a new stable release of Ceph Argonaut, I seem to be having better
luck with playing with the development releases of Ceph.</p>

<p>Oh how I wish that there was a backport of the kernel ceph and rbd drivers,
I have a dodgy repo and some reverts that one of the guys in work
told me about. It seems to run but it isn&#8217;t great, it can be found at

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having learnt how to remove and add monitor&#8217;s, meta-data and data servers (mon&#8217;s, mds&#8217;s
and osd&#8217;s) for my small two node Ceph cluster. I want to say that it wasn&#8217;t too hard to
do, the ceph website does have documentation for this.</p>

<p>As the default CRUSH map replicates across OSD&#8217;s I wanted to try replicating data across
hosts just to see what would happen. In a real world scenario I would probably treat
individual hosts in a rack as a failure unit and if I had more than one rack of storage,
I would want to treat each rack as the minimum unit.</p>

<p>One of the coolest features of ceph is that it allows me to play with different mappings
and configurations of where my data gets allocated. There aren&#8217;t many (if any) storage
systems that I know of which provides this type of capability.</p>

<p>So the steps that I went through to get to what I wanted&#8230;</p>

<p>First I had to dump the CRUSH map from my cluster of two nodes and three (very unbalanced OSD&#8217;s so I can play with the weights).</p>

<pre><code>ceph osd getcrushmap -o /tmp/mycrushmap
</code></pre>

<p>The CRUSH map that is created is a binary file it must be decoded to plain text before
you can edit it.</p>

<pre><code>crushtool -d /tmp/mycrushmap &gt; /tmp/mycrushmap.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s the map that is decoded from the binary file</p>

<pre><code># begin crush map

}

        hash 0  # rjenkins1
        item rack-1 weight 2.000
}

# rules
rule data {
        ruleset 0

        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take default
        step choose firstn 0 type osd
        step emit
}
rule metadata {
        ruleset 1
        type replicated

        max_size 10
        step take default

        step emit
}
rule rbd {
        ruleset 2
        type replicated
        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take default
        step choose firstn 0 type osd
        step emit
}

# end crush map
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant chunks of the config that I&#8217;m interested in is the <strong>rule NAME {}</strong> blocks.
As I&#8217;m interested in making my data, meta-data and probably my rbd rule replicate across hosts, I naturally made the rule look like this</p>

<pre><code>rule data {
        ruleset 0
        type replicated
        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take default
        step choose firstn 0 type host
        step emit
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above change is apparently incorrect as the last step before the <em>step emit</em> needs
to be a device of some sort. I had found this out after posting the ceph-devel mailing
list. There were two proposed solutions (thanks to Greg from inktank), the first
proposed rule was</p>

<pre><code>rule data {
        ruleset 0
        type replicated
        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take default
        step choose firstn 0 type host
        step choose firstn 1 osd
        step emit
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which selects <em>n</em> hosts then the first osd from each host, but it can&#8217;t deal with an entire hosts failed OSD&#8217;s. The second proposed rule was</p>

<pre><code>rule data {
        ruleset 0
        type replicated
        min_size 1
        max_size 10
        step take default
        step chooseleaf firstn 0 type host
        step emit
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above rule will select <em>n</em> hosts and an OSD from the host. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that
the second rule is the one that I want. I would expect that if I had more machines in
racks and rows I could probably just replace host with rack, row or even data-center.</p>

<p>With the second proposed rule, I made the changes to <em>mycrushmap.txt</em>. Once the changes
are made, I had to compile the map into a binary format that the ceph cluster
understands, this can be done by</p>

<pre><code>crushtool -c /tmp/mycrushmap.txt -o /tmp/mycrushmap.new
</code></pre>

<p>Once the map is compiled it must then be applied to the cluster</p>

<pre><code>ceph osd setcrushmap -i /tmp/mycrushmap.new
</code></pre>

<p>The above is documented on the ceph website. Once I applied the new CRUSH map I ran a <em>ceph -w</em> to see that
the system had detected the changes and it then started to move data around on its own. I&#8217;ll need to play
with pulling out the network cable or SATA cables to see how the system behaves from me causing catastrophic
failures in the test system.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I took the long way around to making the changes, there must be a more dynamic way of
changing the system.</p>

<p>To recap and review the above operation, it&#8217;s again no harder than my reference system that I know, which is
GPFS. GPFS doesn&#8217;t allow me to do what ceph allows me to do. I would however like to see some more visible
documentation relating to the CRUSH configuration parameters and tuneables.</p>

<p>So far this has been a distraction from my main day job, but this will certainly help
with the project that I am working on in the long run.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having created a small single node Ceph cluster with following the <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start/">5 minute quickstart</a> guide I was able to create a single node cluster with one OSD.</p>

<p>This probably wouldn&#8217;t be the first post that someone has written about this topic.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve verified that it works in my test environment of Scientific Linux

<p>I&#8217;m using an old desktop machine so I can plonk some &#8220;files&#8221; on it so I
can dogfood the test system in administering the bits and pieces of Ceph.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my current Ceph configuration (before I add a new OSD)</p>

<pre><code>[global]
    #auth supported = cephx
    #keyring = /etc/ceph/ceph.keyring
    filestore xattr use omap = true

[osd]
    osd journal size = 1000
    filestore xattr use omap = true

[mon.a]
    host = x.y.z.194
    mon addr = x.y.z.194:6789
    mon data = /data/mon.$id
[mds.a]
    host = x.y.z.194
    mon data = /data/mds.$id

[osd.0]
    host = x.y.z.194
    osd data = /data/osd.$id
    osd journal = /data/osd.$id.journal
</code></pre>

<p>I was a little caught out by the <em>osd journal</em> setting, I did not realise
that I needed to set this value if I set a journal size.</p>

<p>So to add a new OSD to a running system I followed the instructions at
<a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/ops/manage/grow/osd/">http://ceph.com/docs/master/ops/manage/grow/osd/</a>. This involves
allocating a new OSD id, editting the ceph.conf file, formatting the
OSD then adjusting the CRUSH map to allocate data to the new OSD.</p>

<pre><code>ceph osd create
1
</code></pre>

<p>I then added these lines to my ceph.conf file (as this is my test system,
I&#8217;ve ignored all sensible naming conventions)</p>

<pre><code>[osd.1]
    host = x.y.z.194
    osd data = /data$id/osd.$id
    osd journal = /data$id/osd.$id.journal
</code></pre>

<p>I then create the directory for osd.1</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /data1/osd.1
</code></pre>

<p>Once the above is done, I need to initialise the osd data directory,
this can be done with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>ceph-osd -i 1 --mkfs
</code></pre>

<p>As I am not using any authentication (for now) I do not bother with keys
and the such.</p>

<p>With the above done, one can verify that the OSD has been added to the
system by executing the following command</p>

<pre><code># ceph osd tree
dumped osdmap tree epoch 10
# id    weight  type name       up/down reweight
-1      1       pool default
-3      1               rack unknownrack
-2      1                       host x.y.z.194
0       1                               osd.0   up      1

1       0       osd.1   down    0
</code></pre>

<p>Once the osd is in the cluster, it must be added to the CRUSH map. Given the above, the command that I need to execute would be</p>

<pre><code>ceph osd crush set 1 osd.1 1.0 pool=default rack=unknownrack host=x.y.z.194
</code></pre>

<p>Running the osd tree command again will show that I have added the OSD to my host</p>

<pre><code># ceph osd tree
dumped osdmap tree epoch 11
# id    weight  type name       up/down reweight
-1      2       pool default
-3      2               rack unknownrack
-2      2                       host x.y.z.194
0       1                               osd.0   up      1
1       1                               osd.1   down    0
</code></pre>

<p>However the state is down for <em>osd.1</em>, it must be brought up before it
is usable. It can be brought up by doing,</p>

<pre><code># service ceph -a start osd
# ceph osd tree
dumped osdmap tree epoch 13
# id    weight  type name       up/down reweight
-1      2       pool default
-3      2               rack unknownrack
-2      2                       host x.y.z.194
0       1                               osd.0   up      1
1       1                               osd.1   up      1
</code></pre>

<p>If I do a <em>df -h</em> I should see an increase in the space that is available.</p>

<pre><code># df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg_ceres-lv_root
               50G  5.5G   42G  12% /

/dev/mapper/vg_ceres-lv_home
                  176G  1.2G  166G   1% /data1
</code></pre>

<p>Given that I have in the past administered GPFS and Lustre filesystem
in production, this doesn&#8217;t look too bad. I don&#8217;t know the system that
well, but the configuration is pretty sensible and straight forward.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no harder than GPFS where one needs to create an NSD, then add the
NSD to a GPFS filesystem, nor is it more harder than just <em>mounting</em>
and OST in Lustre.</p>

<p>There does seem to be one or two additional things that a Ceph admin
would need to know before they can admin it optimally. However from the
initial playing around it looks like it needs more documentation, for
the seasoned parallel/distributed sysadmin this system is pretty neat
and tidy. However for the less experienced it looks like it might be a
bit hard to grasp some of the concepts before one can be an effective
admin of Ceph.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve gone through the process of adding an OSD to my small test
cluster, I think the next thing to try is to play with the CRUSH map to
see if I can get Ceph replicate data between my OSD&#8217;s even though
they are on the one machine. I guess the place to look at next is
<a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Adjusting_replication_level">http://ceph.com/wiki/Adjusting_replication_level</a></p>

<p>Without getting into the finer details of all this, in GPFS you can only
have a replica size of 1 or 2 and you can only play with failure groups
of NSD&#8217;s and nodes. GPFS does a lot to hide things from the admin, this
is probably a good thing. Lustre doesn&#8217;t allow replicas at all (or
raid1). As powerful as Ceph is, I would imagine at some point someone
will ask &#8220;can I just have a tool to set the replica count assuming I
have configured my machines and OSD lists accordingly&#8221;</p>

<p>However the sysadmin in me just wants documentation as Ceph seems to
be almost ready for competing against GPFS and Lustre (as well as the
other parallel and distributed file systems).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After my last failed attempt at <a href="/2012/07/06/installing-ceph-on-sl6/">Installing Ceph on
SL6</a> or rather my attempt at
configuring Ceph for a test failed miserably.</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t deterred me to test more. As a result I setup a number of
Vagrant Virtual machines and got together a few puppet scripts to
provision machines.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a sample manifest for puppet to automate the deployment of a
machine to build Ceph. It requires that you SL6 environment to have at
least the epel repository enabled.</p>

<p>With the Virtual Machines I was able to download the latest <a href="http://www.ceph.com/download/ceph-0.51.tar.bz2">Ceph
0.51</a> and do at least
the following</p>

<ul>
<li>unpack the tarball</li>
<li>do a <em>./configure</em> to generate the <em>ceph.spec</em> file</li>
<li>copy (or move) the ceph tarball into ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES</li>
<li>execute a <em>rpmbuild -ba ceph.spec</em> to build the source and binary rpm packages for installation</li>
</ul>


<p>After the RPM&#8217;s were built and installed, I again followed the quick
guide at <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start/">http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start/</a> and was able
to setup a small 3 node cluster for playing around with.</p>

<p>So to note, I tried out the cephfs feature (via the fuse module) and
creating(destroying and resizing) RBD&#8217;s. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to
experiment with the kernel modules to actually do something useful with
the POSIX filesystem or RBD&#8217;s that Ceph provides.</p>

<p>It would be worth nothing that the Ceph project are working on providing
prebuilt RPM&#8217;s soon, there is already a <a href="http://ceph.com/gitbuilder-centos6-rpm-amd64/">gitbuilder instance for the rpm
build</a> or just go to their
<a href="http://ceph.com/gitbuilder.cgi">gitbuilder aggregator</a></p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Over past few weeks I&#8217;ve been working on doing some integration and
testing work to try and deliver a prototype system. I&#8217;ve taken the
<a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> tool and puppet to try and deliver
systems for testing and development. Although the systems that I am
currently working with aren&#8217;t fully automated, they are automated
enough for them to be easily started up by a developer who reads the
documentation (I hope).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that by providing these disposable systems that the various
members in the team that I am working with will be more free to experiment
and less fearful of breaking the system. At best everyone will take the
idea on board and run with it as it does provide a common environment
for all members in the team and it encourages reproducibility of issues
and features.</p>

<p>One of the next steps of building up the development framework that I
now have is to introduce some of these concepts and the whole Vagrant
environment to the more front facing part of the team who need to deal
with stakeholders in the project. If our requirements and policy team have
constant up to date access to our development, testing and QA environment
along with the executable specifications (in the form of cucumber tests)
I hope to push forward communications between the stakeholders and the
team that I&#8217;m working with.</p>

<p>For now I have one VM for the application itself and a number of
&#8220;clusters&#8221; of VM&#8217;s which I had used for reviewing some technical
documentation, they are partially automated for others to
play with. Currently these scripts are internal to the project
only, but it&#8217;s not hard to setup if you know how to configure
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. Some of the scripts and ideas can
be found at <a href="https://github.com/jcftang/tchpc-vagrant">tchpc-vagrant</a>,
they&#8217;re not great, but not bad either. I need more of the developers in
the team to use what I&#8217;ve setup to evolve the system more for our use.</p>

<p>In parallel to using this for my day job, I&#8217;ve
also setup a Vagrantfile for one of my pet projects
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/cports">cports</a>. Using Vagrant for testing
builds and deployments of a packaging system has been great. I&#8217;ve been
able to do clean rebuilds of various packages without fear of completely
polluting the enviroment, as its just a few commands away from being
redeployed and provisioned. I&#8217;ll need to play more and then release it
to the HPC community (or those that care).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a long time consumer of ruby applications but never quite
got around to learning the language and the frameworks that are
available to developers. Within the team that I have been working
with, we&#8217;ve been evaluating <a href="http://projecthydra.org">hydra</a> as a
possible framework for our project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been spending the last few days reading
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a>, I&#8217;ve
been able to pick up some of the basic syntax of the language from the
BDD book. As soon as I finish this book I will be moving on to a more
real world book relating to ruby with the goal of being able to
develop Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t get as far as finishing the RSpec book and I&#8217;ve started
creating a rubygem. I&#8217;m attempting to expose the insides of
<a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/zfec/">zfec</a>, specifically the
functionality in <em>fec.c</em>. So far I&#8217;ve been lazy and I am using swig to
automatically generate the C to ruby bindings with something like this</p>

<p>Amazingly after some fiddling I got ruby to load up the module. It
doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to do much though as I need to learn
about the typemaps in the ruby C interface do the correct mappings.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so far taking inspiration from the zfec python module to take a
stab at building a ruby equivalent package for the sake of learning
ruby and maybe even end up with something useful for the project that
I am working on in work.</p>

<p>After playing with extending ruby, I&#8217;m thinking I may need to take a
step back and evaluate if this is the best way for me to learn ruby or
not. I should probably not mess too much extending the language with a
C library.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having discovered <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</a> recently at OR2012 I&#8217;ve
been building a few <em>boxes</em> for our site for testing purposes. I&#8217;ve
had to relearn puppet to provision machines, but it&#8217;s paying off. I&#8217;ve
been able to deploy 3-4 virtual machines with relative ease.</p>

<p>The only disappointment is the seemingly frequent and semi-random
kernel panics and crashes that I get on OSX (which is probably caused
by VirtualBox when I do lots of IO). It&#8217;s making me rethink if I
really want to stick with OSX as my primary desktop OS in work. I may
have to revert back to using Linux at somepoint.</p>

<p>At least in Linux I know how to get a kdump out and debug the issue
but with OSX I&#8217;m not sure where I should begin to figure out what&#8217;s
broken.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I only discovered <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant">Vagrant</a> last
week at OR2012 when one of the presentations had Vagrant as a part of
the testing component in the project. I was pleasantly surprised that
it was leaveraging lots of free and opensource technology to provide
repeatable environments for development and testing. I was even more
impressed by the <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">Veewee</a> project
which provides some additional wrappers for building custom
&#8216;boxes&#8217;. Veewee certainly saved me lots of time in setting up some
updated <a href="http://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a> boxes
(it&#8217;s my preferred distro for deployments).</p>

<p>In summary Vagrant is a set of scripts to manage virtual machines and
Veewee is a set of scripts for creating base images for use in
Vagrant. If you&#8217;re interested in the updated SL6.2 definitions they
can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/veewee/tree/scientificlinux-6.2">fork of veewee</a>.</p>

<p>All that is left now is to setup <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> and
have it automatically provision my development/test environment. I&#8217;m
not a huge fan of puppet, but I guess it&#8217;s better than rolling my own.</p>

<p>I look forward to have the capability of having easy access to
disposable VM&#8217;s for prototyping and testing! I will need to at
somepoint setup a test system for cports with this tool.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I finally had gotten back from the conference late in the evening on
Friday, airport security was not fun at all. It was the first Open
Repositories conference that I had attended, the community seems to be
pretty tightly knit. There were two or three software stacks which
were presented that looked useful.  Things such as Fedora-Commons,
Hydra and a few other sub-components which were talked about are going
to be likely building blocks that we will be using for our Digital
Repository.</p>

<p>There was also a developer challenge which I decided to enter at the
last minute, it was both a new and interesting experience at
presenting something that wasn&#8217;t well prepared to an audience that I
had no experience with either. By the way, I was a team of one! I had
proposed the idea that replicating data can be expensive and bad,
there are alternatives to just copying files around en-mass and
storing replicas left right and centre.</p>

<p>I promised I would post some photos, but it seems my photos aren&#8217;t as
interesting as the ones that other people took. See
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/or2012/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/or2012/</a>.</p>

<p>Next year Open Repositories will be held in Prince Edward Island,
Canada. I will need to be better prepared next year (assuming I go).</p>
