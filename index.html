<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that ZFS On Linux reached a significant milestone, that is the
software is stable to use on Linux. This is pretty useful and significant
for the preservation and archivists community as it provides a more
reliable platform to build on. The LLNL guys must really want to mitigate
against silent data failures in their systems (they&#39;re running Lustre
on top of ZFS).</p>

<p>If ZFS is trustable or not we will know over time. At least with
ZFS&#39;s data protection features we will see less issues with silent
data corruption.</p>

<p>If one could build glusterfs or better yet, Ceph on top of ZFS it would
be pretty desirable.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>At work we like to do lots of testing and behaviour driven development
since we have a number of stakeholders and institutions all working on
the same application. To make sure everyone is getting what they want
we&#39;re using cucumber to write our specifications; that is we&#39;re primarily
doing outside in developement of our system.</p>

<p>As such we like to test things in a near production like
environment&hellip; Having chosen to use <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit</a> to test
the interface (at a very functional and simplistic level) on our
workstations. I decided to test drive the vagrant enviroment that I had
been working on the past few months. Btw, this environment is bootstrapped
with ansible, I&#39;m a much happier person since I ditched puppet.</p>

<p>Annoyingly in RHEL6 and friends QT is a little bit behind the current
times, we needed at least QT4.7 to run the javascript tests (which rely
on webkit). The first an obvious thing was to uninstall qt from the base
system and then install qt47 from atrpms-testing.</p>

<p>Little did I know that <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=886996">tomcat6 depends</a> on redhat-lsb which in turn
depends on qt-x11 and so on&hellip; My plans on testing and developing our
application in a near production environment almost got shot.</p>

<p>In the end the solution was to test the java script components with either
selenium or better yet <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">poltergeist</a> for capybara. We chose poltergeist
as it runs headless. This isn&#39;t really a problem of cucumber/capybara,
but rather a problem of RHEL6 and friends with old packages.</p>

<p>&hellip;after sometime I have a half-way there set of ansible playbooks to
get me to where I need to be in a virtual environment&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;less rant &hellip;</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve been recently reading up on Amazon <a href="">Redshift</a>, at first I thought
it was a parallel/distributed datastore like HDFS. At a second look in
reality its more of a distributed relational database. This in itself
is pretty cool for scaling applications with large data sets that happen
to need to be in a database; which is quite a few things.</p>

<p>From the initial reading of the architecture and docs, it looks like
Amazon built a job queuing system around postgres to schedule queries
out to its nodes in the cluster. What&#39;s curious to me is how do they
deal with failed nodes in the system and how they provision the system,
there must be an ordered set of operations to do so.</p>

<p>Another oddity is the mesh network that the system has, I&#39;m under the
impression that there is only 1x10gb network connection on the machine. I
wonder if the mesh network is just a virtual mesh network or if it&#39;s
really a real physical one. If it&#39;s a real physical mesh network then
each machine would require more than one network interface. It would
also be a cabling nightmare to build such a device and if Amazon has
built a large scale mesh network of machines, that would be pretty cool.
I wonder how much of the Redshift user base are latency, bandwidth or
compute bound when looking at large datasets; or if its really just the
challenge of having one real big database that can be queried.</p>

<p>We had to unpack and install all the infiniband cards ourselves, cabled,
racked, installed, configured and burnt it in for production usage. The
cluster has 100 nodes, each node has 2 sockets, each socket has 6 cores
and 24gb of ram.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about this machine was that we got it with
QLogic infiniscale/infinipath HCA&#39;s and switching. It was one of the if
not the lowest latency networking that we could get at the time.</p>

<p>When we were configuring this system we had also redesigned the storage
system roughly around this period and went with a cluster to cluster
GPFS configuration.</p>

<p>Oh and we threw out the old cluster which was about 10racks of IBM e326
machines in the process.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After a few months of budgeting, negotiations and finding venues we&#39;ve
at Trinity College Dublin have committed to hosting a HydraCamp for
europe! So I&#39;m shamelessly plugging it here.</p>

<p>Trinity College Dublin as a part of Digital Repository of Ireland will
be organising Hydra Camp in the week of April 8th till 12th, 2013. This
will be a week long training course, which will be aimed at developers
who are interested in the Hydra framework for developing repositories.</p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t know Hydra is a framework built upon various
Fedora-Commons, Apache SOLR, Ruby and Ruby on Rails technologies. At
DRI we&#39;re using it to build up our prototype repository.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to use the Hydra framework to build repositories for
archiving and preservation.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We&#39;ve been ramping up our development work on the project that I have been on
in the last month or so. One of the issues that we&#39;ve come across is the not
so good XML validation and parsing libraries that are available in the ruby
world compared to the java world.</p>

<p>So as an exercise I decided to see if I could make our prototype work
with jruby with the view of doing a test deployment on tomcat or some
other application server. One of the motivating reason for doing this
is to get access to the java based XML libraries for validation and
processing. It also means that if I can deploy to the same Tomcat server
where I&#39;m running SOLR and Fedora-Commons then it means I&#39;m saving myself
a chunk of work setting up and maintaining <em>mod_passenger</em>.</p>

<p>In short what I ended up doing was make sqlite3 as being dependent on
the ruby platform and creating a block for jruby. So here&#39;s the relevant
snippet from my <em>Gemfile</em></p>

<p>What I found was that jruby behaves oddly when I&#39;m behind a proxy, it
seems to blindly take my system proxy settings on my mac, so I had to
work around it.</p>

<p>Nokogiri seems to be subtly different when deployed with jruby and thus
it breaks a bunch of things, which is funny as this was the main reason
to testing out jruby so that we can access the java based XML libraries.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having a few days of time off from work I&#39;ve committed to migrating my
archlinux based laptops to using btrfs. I&#39;ve to date been just using
ext4 and nilfs2 (on an SD card) on my eeepc and plain old ext4 on the
bigger laptop.</p>

<p>The main motivation was that the two devices were pretty outdated and
I felt lucky with doing a major upgrade (replaced sysvinit with systemd
as recommended by the archlinux people)</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to reinstall my machines so I took the route of converting
the existing ext4 partitions to btrfs. I left my <em>/boot</em> partition as
ext2 for safety. Prior to converting to btrfs I had upgraded the two
laptops to using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Grub2">grub2</a>
first. I then proceeded to boot up my laptops with the
archlinux installer image via a usb key. Then just followed the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs">btrfs</a> documentation at
the archlinux wiki.</p>

<p>The process went more smoothly than I had anticipated, I didn&#39;t run into
any major stumbling blocks, that said I did have to free up some space
for the migration to occur.</p>

<p>Once the systems were back up and running I enabled compression on btrfs
and defragged the systems</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">find / -xdev -type f -print -exec btrfs filesystem defrag &#39;{}&#39; \;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This compression feature made a huge difference on the space limited
eeepc, the compression feature reclaimed about 10% of the space on the
system. It&#39;s a shame that the RHEL based distros aren&#39;t quite supporting
btrfs yet there are quite a few nice features there that are very
attractive for pro-consumers and the enterprise. RHEL7 will have btrfs,
hopefully there will be backports to RHEL6.</p>

<p>Performance wise I haven&#39;t used the system in anger yet, so time will
tell if I&#39;m happy with btrfs or not.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It was clear at this year&#39;s supercomputing conference that there wasn&#39;t
as much excitement as previous years. There wasn&#39;t much surprise as
nothing too revolutionary and radical was announced. In the past when
Bluegene/L and P arrived after the earth simulator there was an arms race
to being number 1 in the top500 list.  Even things like GPGPU&#39;s aren&#39;t
as cool anymore, everyone is selling effectively the same systems when
it comes to clusters. Not everyone has the budget to procure a specialist
machine like a NEC vector machine, a CRAY, Bluegene/Q etc&hellip;</p>

<p>The arms race to the top is just completely crazy, the top 50 or so
machines are so powerful compared to what a typical university or small
research lab might have access is too is completely skewed. At our site
we&#39;re probably about 0.5% of the top machine. In the past we were about
1-2% typically of the top machine, and we were about 5yrs behind the
curve. The top 500 list should really be renamed to the top 50 list and
the green 500 list or the HPCC list should be used instead as a measure
of the top machines in the world. Do people really think that LINPACK
is a good measure of how powerful a machine is going to be?</p>

<p>What was interesting at this year&#39;s conference was some of the papers
and panels were focused on project management and data management of
scientific datasets. I noticed that when people are starting to worry
about meta-data standards like librarians, people are starting to think
about archiving the data, they probably haven&#39;t thought about the access
component of preservation which will be amusing when they do realise
it. There is also a disconnect from some of the papers which focused on
silent data corruption at the storage and network layers. The archiving
and preservation space for HPC will need to deal with bit-flips, silent
data corruption, malicious users and all that funk that is related to it.</p>

<p>After having a few chats with some vendors during the week, /me eyes
them vendors. There seems to be a bit of a lack of understanding that
archiving and preservation of data isn&#39;t just about bulk, cheap and
reliable storage. There are apects to it which require data processing and
analytics of the data. It seems somewhat pointless to archive data and not
index it, process it and deliver it to who needs it. At somepoint the data
will be touched for checksumming, surrogate generation, delivery to the
end user. There also seems to be a lack of a guarantee of data-integrity
at the filesystem level. It appears that this responsiblity is left to
the application developer.</p>

<p>Would storage vendors (filesystems, devices the whole stack!) please
consider providing end to end data integrity? If the guys at the top are
trying to reach exascale computing in the next 5 years then the storage
component needs to catch up. Other sectors would also benefit from the
end to end data integrity built into storage systems.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having spent the best part of my Sunday afternoon playing with ansible
just to learn and see what all the fuss is about, I was pleasantly
surprised with it.</p>

<p>I had installed <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">ansible</a> on my OSX
laptop and <a href="https://github.com/ansible/vagrant-ansible">vagrant-ansible</a>
for my vagrant test environment.</p>

<p>The plan was to try and re-create my current ruby on rails development
and test virtual machine with vagrant. A secondary goal was to get it
to work with both Ubuntu Precise (LTS) and Scientific Linux 6.</p>

<p>My attempt at doing the above can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/tchpc-vagrant/tree/ansible">tchpc-vagrant</a>
in the ansible branch. You will need ansible installed on your host
machine. You don&#39;t need much installed in the target machine as ansible
is designed to login and execute commands as required, this is quite
refreshing. Compared to puppet and chef, if I were to roll this out
into production my overhead will be pretty low. This low overhead is
something that I really like as I don&#39;t need to setup an infrastructure
just to run puppet.</p>

<p>In short I was able to learn how ansible is supposed to work (I think)
and build up enough configuration to start up a vagrant vm with what I
need for to do rails development in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>One thing that did occur to me was the lack of windows support, given
that ansible is designed to use ssh to carry out its activities, finding
stock windows machines which run ssh is pretty slim. This is one area
which puppet (perhaps chef too) is better at. It&#39;s also one feature that
I would like as the vagrant vm&#39;s that we&#39;re using in work might be given
to windows users for testing and evaluation.</p>

<p>Going forward I think ansible will certainly be in my toolkit. There really is
a light on the otherside for mangement, deployment and orchestration.</p>
