<div class="entry-content"><p>Team meetings can be both productive and counter productive as most
people find. If they are well structured with a purpose and goal then
a lot can be achieved (most of the time).</p>

<p>For explorartory meetings, it&#8217;s probably okay to have some time set
aside for some free and open discussions. Once a goal has been agreed
upon, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to focus on it more and steer the
discussion to try and deliver on the goal. Having open ended
discussions with no set goals sometimes is discouraging and sometimes
a waste of time.</p>

<p>To the point, I wanted to discuss some things not to say and do in a
meeting which might cause a collapse in communications, these are just
some things that I have noticed in the last few months worth of
meetings and are based on my own experiences,</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume you know everything, there will always be someone
smarter than you. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with being an expert in your
own area, but there are times where you just need to trust others to
deliver.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t pick on other team members for (possibly) not delivering, this
is hugely demoralising. It&#8217;s better to ask why, and if possible does
that team member or members need help to deliver.</li>
<li>In real life, does anyone really use waterfall methods to deliver a
project?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try and do micro-management if you are clearly middle or even
senior management, but at least describe tasks in the same language
as the stakeholder and developer so that things don&#8217;t get lost in
translation.</li>
<li>Do have a plan if the series of meetings are to last a few months if
there are long term goals to be achieved. If it&#8217;s not a plan, then
at least have a list of todo, work in progress and done tasks.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assign tasks without deadlines (realistic ones).</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume you are on the same page in discussions unless you are
confident that everyone at the meeting has common language and
understands what is being discussed. People come and go, so you just
have to be aware.</li>
</ul>


<p>Most if not all of the above list of things is common sense, there
isn&#8217;t anything too special that you need to do to succeed at
communicating.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>SL6.2 has been out for a few days now, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to
really take a look at it, since the more recent SL6 installs I
maintain tend to be tracking the 6x releases. Hopefully SL will try
and keep inline with the upstreams support schedule.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve a personal preference for deploying SL over CentOS (or any other
recompiles of RHEL). SL tends to be a bit more polished in terms of
not breaking older installs, i.e. the upstream doesn&#8217;t move point
releases around as CentOS does, SL does not force the end user to run
the latest stable or continually upgrade to the latest point release
to get updates (due to the weird convention CentOS seems to have with
their archives).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s out, I need to look at it again, especially since ZFS is getting
closer to being ready for a bit more general usage on the server side
and the project that I am working will be needing some machines to be
installed and setup soon.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>At the time of writing it seems that the Raspberry Pi site is down,
probably suffering from a slashdot effect. I would imagine almost
every nerd, sheevaplug developer, OLPC developer, DIY&#8217;ers who want to
build their own home media centres are looking to get a Raspberry Pi
right now.</p>

<p>So what would I use one of these mini-computers for? I can think up a
range of cool applications for this device, assuming I can order a few
of these to play with. I&#8217;ve got ideas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Tahoe-LAFS storage node, I could attach a few HDD&#8217;s to one of these
devices and run Tahoe-LAFS on it, these computers are cheap enough
and have a low enough power consumption that I could just have them
on all the time.</li>
<li>A Babeld node, I could have a few of these devices dotted around my
house/apartment to build a mesh network.</li>
<li>A portable computer, not quite a tablet PC with a screen, but it has
enough connectivity to wire it up to a modern monitor or a TV.</li>
<li>A penetration testing device, just wire it up with a few DC
batteries, plug in a wireless card, wrap it up in a water proof
package. Power on, and see how far you can throw it at your target,
I can see endless possibilities for this device for pen-testing.</li>
</ul>


<p>I wonder if the device will ever be able to be powered via the USB
port or the the ethernet port. I can see some interesting uses for
this device in data centres for monitoring the network, power
consumption and a host of other things.</p>

  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Why would one want to target other platforms when building applications
on the server side?</p>

<p>This came out of a conversation with the ex-CTO of Creme software (he
is also a friend of mine), the conversation started out with why I
like to use Macs and OSX as my laptop or workstation. I&#8217;ve been a long
time Linux user of pretty much most of the major distributions ranging
from RHEL, Debian/Ubuntu, Gentoo, ArchLinux as well as a number of
other derivatives, not to mention other systems like the BSD&#8217;s which I
have a soft spot for.</p>

<p>I interchange the terms Linux and Distros quite a bit in this post.</p>

<p>Some of the things that didn&#8217;t like with the Linux&#8217;s was that not all
my hardware would be supported all the time, the distro&#8217;s sometimes
think that it&#8217;s a good idea to completely change how lowlevel systems
work in favour of <em>what&#8217;s hot right now</em>, sometimes the lack of long
term support for security updates (not package updates to fix security
problems) does make it more difficult to plan and deploy. The
perceived flexibility sometimes causes headaches with migration plans
and maintanence.</p>

<p>Of course there are things that I like, the access to the source code
and packaging to fix and redeploy packages. The stability and
reliability that can be achieved is attractive if everything is
automated and planned out (though too much automation can be bad too).</p>

<p>To get back to the original point of why you wouldn&#8217;t want to target
Linux specifically when building applications? Unless you have a
strong motivating reason to write code that <em>specifically</em> requires a
feature of Linux (or any other operating system), then you really
ought to be writing code that adheres to at least some POSIX or cross
platform standard, and pick libraries that are known to have good
cross platform compatibility. There is nothing to gain from writing
platform specific codes in the long run, the platform might hide
issues from the developer if it is too clever. Linux or more
specifically the distros might change various behaviour of the
underlying system, and if your code is tied down to particular
features of the underlying system then you will have lots of fun
migrating.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just bad practice to rely on system specific behaviour which
isn&#8217;t portable (or maintainable) going forward in a project. To
mitigate some of this, one would want to at least try to use a
continuous build systems such as <em>gitbuilder</em>, <em>buildbot</em> or <em>jenkins</em>
on a bunch of <strong>different</strong> architectures and platforms. This will
reveal portability issues and more often than not, subtle bugs in your
code which you probably didn&#8217;t see as a result of your development
system being too smart for you!</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much of an excuse not to do continuous builds and testings
across different Linux, BSD and Solaris distributions these
days. Diskspace and compute power is cheap, there are free and
opensource virtualisation technologies out there to provide you with a
means to run different distributions for testing on a single
machine. The problem will be the upfront manpower needed to setup such
a system.</p>

<p>In the long run targetting at least two platforms will make your code
base far more portable and hopefully more maintainable as you will end
up making sure you write code once that runs on many systems with
minimal changes needed when a new platform arises.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve talked about <em>cports</em> in the past, it&#8217;s basically a collection of
<em>makefiles</em> which mostly automates the process of downloading,
configuring, building and installing applications and libraries for
High Performance Computing systems that use environment-modules.</p>

<p>One of the key-features that <em>cports</em> offers is the automated
modulefile generation, and the fact that the <em>makefiles</em> acts as
documentation to how software is configured, built and installed. It&#8217;s
currently being used on the clusters at my work place, it has been a
boost to the productivity of the systems admin team. It&#8217;s a nice
alternative to trying to create RPM&#8217;s or DEB&#8217;s (pick your custom
package manager of choice here), as <em>makefiles</em> tend to be a little
more flexible than traditional package managers.</p>

<p>One main drawback of the <em>cports</em> system right now is the lack of good
dependancy management and checking, it is all currently up to the
packager to resolve these dependancy issues. It&#8217;s also <em>cports</em>
strongest point that there is no dependancy management, as the
packager can build many unique trees of packages.</p>

<p>For example, we have Tahoe-LAFS in the following sample makefile</p>

<p>In this example, as Tahoe-LAFS (upstream project) gets updated, the
cports packager just needs to copy this makefile to a new directory,
update the version numbers, then do a <em>make install</em>. This assumes
that the dependancies haven&#8217;t changed much, if they have it is trivial
to update the dependancies. The above example generates a modulefile
similar to like this,</p>

<p>Once the package has been built and tested on a development system, we
can take the package and replicate the installation in fairly
automated fashion. This type of scripting and automation means that
the clusters that we run in work have consistent installations of
applications.</p>

<p>Having consistent installs means that the end-user needs to learn less
about the naming conventions. This in turn reduces the confusion and
documentation that is needed for the end user.</p>

<p>Sadly, I don&#8217;t get to play with <em>cports</em> as much as I used to, since I
do not administrate High Performance Computing systems anymore in my
new role at my current work place. It is just a hobby to develop this
build system, I plan on automating more testing of the <em>cports</em> system
when I get a chance. We currently have <em>jenkins</em> and <em>gitbuilder</em>
running on select machines in work to continually build and test
specific packages to find regressions and broken download links.</p>

<p><em>cports</em> isn&#8217;t quite ready for general public usage, but if you are a
clued in systems administrator at a High Performance Computing
facility and use environment-module then <em>cports</em> is just about
usable. This is of course if you are willing to look at the sample
packages and write <em>makefiles</em>.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s all over the internet that RHEL6 and newer releases will have a
life cycle of 10yrs. This is pretty good news for projects that are
deploying systems that have a lifetime of 5yrs or more. Namely Digital
Preservation projects, not having to worry about migration between
point releases of an operating system platform reduces time and costs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now more likely to target the systems we develop in work towards a
RHEL system (or a RHEL like clone).</p>

<p>Another side effect of this long term support is that it will probably
make life easier for those who have lots of virtual machines running
RHEL. Longer support means less issues with continually migrating
between point releases. From a practical point of view of a
operational sysadmin, this is great. From a developers point of view,
it&#8217;s also not bad either, software written now (assuming the
requirements haven&#8217;t changed) will probably work long into the future.</p>

<p>Note: I am not a RHEL (Fedora) fanboy, I used to sysadmin a few
hundred RHEL (scientific linux) based systems. Before that, I used to
sysadmin a few hundred Debian based systems.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Waterfall methods seem to work well for smallish projects that are
well defined and well understood. At least from my own experiences of
putting things together, but realistically to think of all possible
scenarios and to write up all the possible solutions to the problem
seems a little bit wacky. To also assume that the requirements process
has captured requirements that won&#8217;t change close the end of the
project is also a little unreasonable or unrealistic, this would be
especially true on a project that is planned to run for a few years
with fairly substantial goals in an ever changing research and
development environment.</p>

<p>Waterfall styled methods just cause problems with planning and
adjusting the process to the needs of the stakeholder (no matter what
the stakeholder thinks they need, they will change their mind). Again
this is especially true for long running projects.</p>

<p>So why not use agile methods? Simply because there is little or no
plan and it requires real collaboration, delegation of tasks and
trust to work towards a common goal. People get afraid perhaps?</p>

<p>The trick is communication and trying to introduce agile methods
slowly and steadily into the system. I&#8217;ve been slowly introducing the
idea of pairings, sprints and elements of scrum with kanban (yes,
that&#8217;s lots of buzz words there already). Getting people to agree to
talk is probably the hardest thing to do, and it&#8217;s even harder to try
and get everyone on the same page without ego&#8217;s getting in the way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s paying off a little for now, the team members are beginning to at
least talk and exchange ideas. In my world that is a huge step
already. Next is it try getting things done by prioritising tasks and
resources.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Apart from the obvious unit testing code which could be fun trying to
convince a team to use. There are things known as &#8216;Continuous
Integration&#8217; processes and servers. The basic idea is to continually
build and test your product automatically and report on successful and
failed builds.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve known about this methodology for long time now but I&#8217;ve never
bothered to install a CI server since it was always for myself. In the
past a loop in a shell script running make and or make test usually
did the trick. Then I discovered gitbuilder which is just a small set
of scripts for automating the process. Today I have Jenkins installed
and I&#8217;m somewhat looking at buildbot as well.</p>

<p>Jenkins appears to be the most responsive and feature rich of the
three systems that I have played with. Buildbot looks lightweight and
scalable.  Though I do miss the git bisect and build on a failure that
gitbuilder provides.</p>

<p>Having to work with a team that is geographically distributed
sometimes makes idea exchanges, organising events and development
difficult. Any tool that I can get my hands on to encourage
collaborative work and discussion is going to be used.</p>

<p>Automating the build and test process also means that it is possible
to automate the release process. If all the &#8216;tests&#8217; pass then why not
release it? I will need to look at integrating things with fitnesse
next. Other benefits from using a CI process or server means that most
if not all things get automated, this turns into a highly valuable
source of documentation for incoming developers and
engineers. Documentation often gets left to the end instead of being
done on a continual basis as the project progresses.</p>

<p>Hopefully the CI server won&#8217;t be used to name and shame developers in
the group, it&#8217;s there to make sure everything is working as expected.</p>

<p>Now to convince the team that building early and continually is
actually a good idea! Having somewhat successfully kicked off some
pairing sessions with various team members is good, but being more
flexible and professional about what we are building is what I&#8217;m
after.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Everytime when I install, reinstall or setup a mac desktop or laptop I
always tend to install the same set of software that I was using. As time
goes on I change what I like to install and what to use. So I&#8217;ve been
keeping notes and logs of that I usually install first.</p>

<p>For my new job I will mainly be writing documents, writing/modify JAVA
code and other bits and pieces that an integrator/architect or release
engineer might want to do.</p>

<p>I will be trying to automate builds, automate tests, assert that the
software must function as expected and so on.</p>

<p>So down to the list of the things that I have initially installed:</p>

<h2>Binary packages</h2>

<p>Packages that I just grabbed from their respective websites</p>

<ul>
<li>Xcode</li>
<li>JDK - apple developer site</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>GitHub Mac</li>
<li>Macports</li>
<li>Eclipse - classic</li>
<li>Perian</li>
<li>iTerm2</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ruby related packages</h2>

<ul>
<li>rvm</li>
<li>showoff</li>
<li>git-scribe</li>
</ul>


<h2>Macports</h2>

<ul>
<li>keychain</li>
<li>git-core</li>
<li>ikiwiki</li>
<li>shiftit</li>
<li>emacs-app</li>
<li>bash-completion</li>
<li>mercurial</li>
<li>mr</li>
<li>ffmpeg</li>
<li>mplayer-devel</li>
<li>dcraw</li>
<li>detox</li>
<li>dos2unix</li>
<li>asciidoc</li>
<li>fossil</li>
<li>zsync</li>
<li>macvim</li>
<li>aria2</li>
<li>openssh</li>
<li>org-mode</li>
<li>tmux</li>
</ul>


<p>The Macports list isn&#8217;t exactly complete, but it&#8217;s pretty close to
what I had explicitly installed. Sadly I tried to install gcc45 and
gcc46 because I wanted to play with some codes which needed a fortran
compiler, this failed to install due to some bootstrapping issue of
the fortran compiler during the build.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to install Haskell and some of the related tools which are
pretty handy for a lazy user. There is also the need for installing
Office for OSX. I wish I could just use plain text.</p>

<p>At somepoint I should grab my previous lists and see what I have
added/removed to my toolbox over the years. So far Lion hasn&#8217;t been
too bad, but I have yet to develop anything or seriously tried to do
anything too technical on this system so far.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having worked in a number of cross institutional projects in the past
has lead me to always be weary about how to interact with
people. Often it&#8217;s the lack of co-ordination and communication that
seems to be the killer. Parts of the team would seem to not know what
other parts of the team are doing and thus either deviate from the
master plan or duplicate work.</p>

<p>Gathering requirements for a project is always fun, translating the
requirements for a developer to create the end product is even more
fun, it often can lead to &#8216;chinese whispers&#8217; where things just get
miscommunicated and misunderstood.</p>

<p>Agreeing on collaborating in a sense that everyone should talk and
making sure everyone is on the same page always seems to be a touchy
subject, everyone is an expert. So many things can be resolved by just
bridging the communication gap. I will be finding this out very soon
in how I manage expectations for the latest project that I am working
on.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should change my approach vector in getting everyone to
communicate their concerns and specifications to deliver the product
that we want to create. The worst thing we can do is spend half our
time developing something based on an early spec only to find out that
the goal posts have changed.</p>
