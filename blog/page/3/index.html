  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s all over the internet that RHEL6 and newer releases will have a
life cycle of 10yrs. This is pretty good news for projects that are
deploying systems that have a lifetime of 5yrs or more. Namely Digital
Preservation projects, not having to worry about migration between
point releases of an operating system platform reduces time and costs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now more likely to target the systems we develop in work towards a
RHEL system (or a RHEL like clone).</p>

<p>Another side effect of this long term support is that it will probably
make life easier for those who have lots of virtual machines running
RHEL. Longer support means less issues with continually migrating
between point releases. From a practical point of view of a
operational sysadmin, this is great. From a developers point of view,
it&#8217;s also not bad either, software written now (assuming the
requirements haven&#8217;t changed) will probably work long into the future.</p>

<p>Note: I am not a RHEL (Fedora) fanboy, I used to sysadmin a few
hundred RHEL (scientific linux) based systems. Before that, I used to
sysadmin a few hundred Debian based systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Waterfall methods seem to work well for smallish projects that are
well defined and well understood. At least from my own experiences of
putting things together, but realistically to think of all possible
scenarios and to write up all the possible solutions to the problem
seems a little bit wacky. To also assume that the requirements process
has captured requirements that won&#8217;t change close the end of the
project is also a little unreasonable or unrealistic, this would be
especially true on a project that is planned to run for a few years
with fairly substantial goals in an ever changing research and
development environment.</p>

<p>Waterfall styled methods just cause problems with planning and
adjusting the process to the needs of the stakeholder (no matter what
the stakeholder thinks they need, they will change their mind). Again
this is especially true for long running projects.</p>

<p>So why not use agile methods? Simply because there is little or no
plan and it requires real collaboration, delegation of tasks and
trust to work towards a common goal. People get afraid perhaps?</p>

<p>The trick is communication and trying to introduce agile methods
slowly and steadily into the system. I&#8217;ve been slowly introducing the
idea of pairings, sprints and elements of scrum with kanban (yes,
that&#8217;s lots of buzz words there already). Getting people to agree to
talk is probably the hardest thing to do, and it&#8217;s even harder to try
and get everyone on the same page without ego&#8217;s getting in the way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s paying off a little for now, the team members are beginning to at
least talk and exchange ideas. In my world that is a huge step
already. Next is it try getting things done by prioritising tasks and
resources.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>



  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apart from the obvious unit testing code which could be fun trying to
convince a team to use. There are things known as &#8216;Continuous
Integration&#8217; processes and servers. The basic idea is to continually
build and test your product automatically and report on successful and
failed builds.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve known about this methodology for long time now but I&#8217;ve never
bothered to install a CI server since it was always for myself. In the
past a loop in a shell script running make and or make test usually
did the trick. Then I discovered gitbuilder which is just a small set
of scripts for automating the process. Today I have Jenkins installed
and I&#8217;m somewhat looking at buildbot as well.</p>

<p>Jenkins appears to be the most responsive and feature rich of the
three systems that I have played with. Buildbot looks lightweight and
scalable.  Though I do miss the git bisect and build on a failure that
gitbuilder provides.</p>

<p>Having to work with a team that is geographically distributed
sometimes makes idea exchanges, organising events and development
difficult. Any tool that I can get my hands on to encourage
collaborative work and discussion is going to be used.</p>

<p>Automating the build and test process also means that it is possible
to automate the release process. If all the &#8216;tests&#8217; pass then why not
release it? I will need to look at integrating things with fitnesse
next. Other benefits from using a CI process or server means that most
if not all things get automated, this turns into a highly valuable
source of documentation for incoming developers and
engineers. Documentation often gets left to the end instead of being
done on a continual basis as the project progresses.</p>

<p>Hopefully the CI server won&#8217;t be used to name and shame developers in
the group, it&#8217;s there to make sure everything is working as expected.</p>

<p>Now to convince the team that building early and continually is
actually a good idea! Having somewhat successfully kicked off some
pairing sessions with various team members is good, but being more
flexible and professional about what we are building is what I&#8217;m
after.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everytime when I install, reinstall or setup a mac desktop or laptop I
always tend to install the same set of software that I was using. As time
goes on I change what I like to install and what to use. So I&#8217;ve been
keeping notes and logs of that I usually install first.</p>

<p>For my new job I will mainly be writing documents, writing/modify JAVA
code and other bits and pieces that an integrator/architect or release
engineer might want to do.</p>

<p>I will be trying to automate builds, automate tests, assert that the
software must function as expected and so on.</p>

<p>So down to the list of the things that I have initially installed:</p>

<h2>Binary packages</h2>

<p>Packages that I just grabbed from their respective websites</p>

<ul>
<li>Xcode</li>
<li>JDK - apple developer site</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>GitHub Mac</li>
<li>Macports</li>
<li>Eclipse - classic</li>
<li>Perian</li>
<li>iTerm2</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ruby related packages</h2>

<ul>
<li>rvm</li>
<li>showoff</li>
<li>git-scribe</li>
</ul>


<h2>Macports</h2>

<ul>
<li>keychain</li>
<li>git-core</li>
<li>ikiwiki</li>
<li>shiftit</li>
<li>emacs-app</li>
<li>bash-completion</li>
<li>mercurial</li>
<li>mr</li>
<li>ffmpeg</li>
<li>mplayer-devel</li>
<li>dcraw</li>
<li>detox</li>
<li>dos2unix</li>
<li>asciidoc</li>
<li>fossil</li>
<li>zsync</li>
<li>macvim</li>
<li>aria2</li>
<li>openssh</li>
<li>org-mode</li>
<li>tmux</li>
</ul>


<p>The Macports list isn&#8217;t exactly complete, but it&#8217;s pretty close to
what I had explicitly installed. Sadly I tried to install gcc45 and
gcc46 because I wanted to play with some codes which needed a fortran
compiler, this failed to install due to some bootstrapping issue of
the fortran compiler during the build.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve yet to install Haskell and some of the related tools which are
pretty handy for a lazy user. There is also the need for installing
Office for OSX. I wish I could just use plain text.</p>

<p>At somepoint I should grab my previous lists and see what I have
added/removed to my toolbox over the years. So far Lion hasn&#8217;t been
too bad, but I have yet to develop anything or seriously tried to do
anything too technical on this system so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having worked in a number of cross institutional projects in the past
has lead me to always be weary about how to interact with
people. Often it&#8217;s the lack of co-ordination and communication that
seems to be the killer. Parts of the team would seem to not know what
other parts of the team are doing and thus either deviate from the
master plan or duplicate work.</p>

<p>Gathering requirements for a project is always fun, translating the
requirements for a developer to create the end product is even more
fun, it often can lead to &#8216;chinese whispers&#8217; where things just get
miscommunicated and misunderstood.</p>

<p>Agreeing on collaborating in a sense that everyone should talk and
making sure everyone is on the same page always seems to be a touchy
subject, everyone is an expert. So many things can be resolved by just
bridging the communication gap. I will be finding this out very soon
in how I manage expectations for the latest project that I am working
on.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should change my approach vector in getting everyone to
communicate their concerns and specifications to deliver the product
that we want to create. The worst thing we can do is spend half our
time developing something based on an early spec only to find out that
the goal posts have changed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started a new role as being a senior software engineer
for an Irish National Project and I have had to refresh my OOP skills
with JAVA.</p>

<p>Naturally I gravitated to free and opensource tools to refresh
myself. This lead me to install Eclipse, which is the the EMACS of the
modern world. I&#8217;ve never had much luck with IDE&#8217;s nor have I liked
using IDE&#8217;s much in the past since I mainly dealt with codes written
in C, Fortran and if I am lucky Perl or C++. This is because my
background is in Applied Mathematics, Phyiscs and High Performance
Computing and the codes in this general area are just plain old and
written by scientists primarily and not engineers. What this means is
that almost every numerical code out there that I have had the build,
hack at, develop for is setup differently with its own build system,
its own way of laying out the code base, code that depends on specific
compiler bugs. The list of fun things just goes on.</p>

<p>Having to deal with old codes written in &#8220;old&#8221; languages really makes
the user or system administrator really learn about the build system,
the compliers that are needed, the environment and the dependancy hell
that they get into at times. Because of these experiences, I&#8217;ve yet
again found that JAVA provides lots and lots of support and protection
for the developer. Other nice things that modern languages like JAVA
provide is really the tools that standardise the workflow. This seems
to have had a huge impact on the quality of systems that are produced.</p>

<p>However I really do appreciate the whole TDD concept, but more
importantly the whole concept of Acceptance Testing Driven Development
and Behavioural Driven Development concepts. The features of modern
IDE&#8217;s hinting users scares me to think that fresh graduates from
university might be too reliant on these modern systems that do too
many things for the developer. It does however give fast feedback to
the developer so that they can learn the language much more easily.</p>

<p>Maybe I just feel like a dinosaur for liking vi/vim or emacs for
writing C programs and shell scripts and liking it. I really do feel
disconnected from what modern developers are doing these
days. Developers these days just have it far easier if JAVA or an
equivalent modern language is used with the appropriate tool. It&#8217;s
just down to a communication problem of creating the right thing.</p>

<p>By the way this is the first post!</p>
