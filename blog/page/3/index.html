<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a> is in the process of
getting <strong>git-annex assistant</strong> crowd funded. I had not been keeping
up to date too much in the last year with git-annex partly because it
met my needs and I never needed to upgrade to the latest tip.</p>

<p>There are a number of really cool features now which is making
git-annex more accessible. I particularly like how the merge and sync
workflows have now been pretty much <em>scripted</em> so there is less to go
wrong!</p>

<p>Once the <strong>Dropbox</strong> like features get implemented git-annex will be
pretty interesting, it won&#8217;t be a complete <em>clone</em> of Dropbox due to
the way that git-annex deals with files (using symlinks), it will be a
pretty good alternative to Dropbox. I wish <em>smudge filters</em> were on
the roadmap as well.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After almost 3 months supervising and working with two interns I&#8217;ve
finally uploaded their work under the GPLv2 License.</p>

</ul>


<p>Please note that the packages above do not represent DRI at all, they
just ended up getting labelled that way for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So what are the above packages? Well they are an attempt at creating a
workflow for the DRIS team in TCD who work on digital preservation,
digitisation, cataloging and a host of other tasks which I probably
don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>The prototype system consists of the DRIS Workflows package and the
API server. The system currently target the problem of ingesting
objects. It tries to map what the librarians/archivists at TCD are
doing to a single interface to increase throughput and quality of the
work (amongst other things).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also able to export the internal meta-data as Dublin-Core, it&#8217;s
not great right now and requires more work and there is a small start
made on MODS as well. It does demonstrate what the interns managed to
achieve in 3 months time with a loose spec on what needed to be
done. The basic design and architecture of the system isn&#8217;t too
different from Hydra, it was very much by accident that we ended up
some similar ideas.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this post is to share the code! and as per
usual, hope someone finds it useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on <em>ceph</em> for quite sometime now. It looks
like <em>ceph</em> is almost ready for production usage. There is now a
support infrastructure and a commercial company backing the
product. So far the OSD, MDS and MON components all run on Linux since
most of the implementation appears to be in the user land I wonder if
it will be ported to non-linux platforms. It&#8217;s be quite nifty if one
could have a heterogeneous network of servers providing storage.</p>

<p>From first glance at shadowing one of the guys in work with this
filesystem, it looks good. It&#8217;s missing some documentation right now
apart from that it&#8217;s going to be a great competitor in the distributed
filesystems arena. It will shake up GPFS and Lustre for sure, it might
even give glusterfs a run for its money in the near future.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In the world of digital preservation and repositories it seems that
there is primarily fedora-commons, dspace, eprints and one or two
other solutions out there for building up digital preservation
systems. The one that really stands out as a framework and toolkit for
building bigger and more complex systems is fedora-commons.</p>

<p>It also happens to be written in JAVA and is a fairly big and complex
system which implements best-practices for storing digital objects
with the sole purpose of preservation. In one of the projects that I
have been working with some interns at work; we have treated
fedora-commons as just storage system where we interface to the
preservation repository via the available REST api.</p>

<p>By using the API it was possible to use node.js to implement the
servers which contained all the business logic. Project Hydra does
something similar or rather we are doing something similar to Project
Hydra, by accident much to my suprise. Hydra uses Ruby on Rails for
its middleware implementation, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much JAVA
there either.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that this decoupled approach with REST servers and
clients to be pretty attractive to anyone who wishes to implement
these types systems. It is interesting to see that the applications
aren&#8217;t being written in JAVA. At least that is what I can see with the
projects that use Hydra (which is sort of the point). Maybe good
enough practice is fine for most use cases.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how many digital preservation projects out there
really use 100% JAVA up to delivery to the client? How many projects
out there are really just mashups of different types of technology
(well planned mashups). Is it because of &#8220;best practice&#8221; for
implementing enterprise applications that JAVA gets so much focus and
attention?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that <a href="git://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree.git">git-subtree</a>
has been merged into the mainline git project. <em>git-subtree</em> is one of
those really useful wrappers for manipulating git repositories if you
are an integrator or don&#8217;t really like git-submodule. It certainly is
a nicer alternative to git-submodule. There is less chance of the
person cloning a git-subtree repository messing up the checkout because
they forgot to initialise the submodules. There is also the added
advantage of not needing to fiddle around scripting up the git-archive
commands for exporting the source tree for a release if you use
git-subtree; actually git-subtree is just plain useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This tool hasn&#8217;t been around for too long, but long enough to make it
into quite a few distros. It looks like it&#8217;s a good alternative to
<em>autossh</em> and <em>tmux</em> which I have been using for the past few
years. Like many new tools like this, if it&#8217;s not around everywhere
it&#8217;s not as useful as it could be.</p>

<p>The only minor criticism of the application is that the <em>mosh</em> command
itself is written in perl, it would be nicer if the wrapper command
would be written in C/C++ like the rest of the application. It would
certainly make it more <em>portable</em>. I guess I should shut up or write
my own mosh wrapper replacement.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#8217;ve got it installed on one or two machines and it
seems nice enough so far. I now need to test it out in the field on a
bad connection when I&#8217;m away at a team meeting. I&#8217;m still not entirely
sure of how good or bad it is in terms of security compared to <em>SSH</em>.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the issues with with dogfooding your own projects to accelerate
development might be the lack of control and feedback from the
specifications and requirements process. To try and mitigate this
effect, automated testing should be done, that is specification,
feature and behavioural testing. Call it what you will, but the basic
idea is to get a common understanding between the stakeholder, project
owner and developer to understand what is being built and to write
automated tests collectively to ensure that it is being
delivered. This might be a narrow view of the whole area, but I&#8217;m just
taking what works for me and using it to deliver the project.</p>

<p>There are <em>many</em> specification/feature/behavioural testing tools out
there for almost language that you can think of, so use what works for
you and your team. The testing process not only ensures that the
prototype is working the way that you intend, but it is also a process
where documentation can also be written at the sametime. This
documentation could be used as an initial proposal to the stakeholder
to put forward what you think they want if there are no clear
specifications or requirements in place.</p>

<p>The interns and I have been working on a small prototype system
for a bigger project and the benefits of writing tests are beginning
to show. It has become apparent to the interns that have been working
on this project that <em>testing is a good thing</em>, especially if it can
be automated. We&#8217;re not quite doing TDD or BDD, but it&#8217;s something
that is in between, we&#8217;re getting there with a tiered set of tests.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re finding that (probably) about 50% of the time of the team is
spent on refactoring, writing tests and documentation. Testing
combined with the automated builder/tester, the team is writing code
smarter and better instead of just churning out masses of code which
isn&#8217;t well tested or documented. Given the choice and based on
experience I would prefer to have code that is tested and
documentated, rather than lots of cool half-working and half-tested
features.</p>

<p>The testing process has been a fantastic way for me to steer the
interns, given how little expertise I have with javascript. The tests
let me learn how the interns have been putting the prototype together,
but it also lets me fuzz up the tests to make sure things are working
and to also write new tests to communicate what I think is needed when
appropriate. We&#8217;ve somewhat combined minimal QA into the development
and testing process.</p>

<p>In the end we hope to have a functional prototype system which does
one thing (one set of workflows) well, have lots of documentation,
have tests to back it up and prove that it works. While having an
implementation is great for the potential stakeholder, having
documentation and tests puts us in an even stronger position.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We use git and <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/gitbuilder">gitbuilder</a> in
work for a large number of projects, we also try and test things as
much as we can. I first noticed that someone had written an aggregator
for gitbuilder at <a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/gitbuilder.cgi">ceph
gitbuilders</a>, this seemed
like a great idea (and it is) except the aggregator at the time didn&#8217;t
quite work very fast and needed some ajax magic.</p>

<p>I had asked for a copy of the aggregator script from the ceph
developers, this was really just a perl hack as they said, but it
works. Since we had some students doing an internship here to learn
new things, I got one of the interns to write an ajax&#8217;d up version of
the aggregator.</p>

<p>After a few weeks worth of usage and minor changes, it&#8217;s a bit more
ready to share with everyone, the ajax&#8217;d up version of the aggregator
can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/gitbuilder/tree/develop/contrib/gitbuilder-ajax">github</a>
account in the develop branch. For fun I updated the main gitbuilder
cgi scripts to use twitter bootstrap and add a link to the errcache
file that gitbuilder generates.</p>

<p>We found that with large builds the logs would just swamp out the
errors and warnings and having access to the errcache helped a lot in
narrowing down where to look for problems, hence the linking to the
errcache.</p>

<p>At somepoint it might be worth re-implementing the gitbuilder scripts
in a single language in a generic way such that it works with other
DVCS&#8217;s that have the bisect feature.</p>
