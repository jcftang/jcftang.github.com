<div class="entry-content"><p>After a few months of budgeting, negotiations and finding venues we&#39;ve
at Trinity College Dublin have committed to hosting a HydraCamp for
europe! So I&#39;m shamelessly plugging it here.</p>

<p>Trinity College Dublin as a part of Digital Repository of Ireland will
be organising Hydra Camp in the week of April 8th till 12th, 2013. This
will be a week long training course, which will be aimed at developers
who are interested in the Hydra framework for developing repositories.</p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t know Hydra is a framework built upon various
Fedora-Commons, Apache SOLR, Ruby and Ruby on Rails technologies. At
DRI we&#39;re using it to build up our prototype repository.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to use the Hydra framework to build repositories for
archiving and preservation.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>We&#39;ve been ramping up our development work on the project that I have been on
in the last month or so. One of the issues that we&#39;ve come across is the not
so good XML validation and parsing libraries that are available in the ruby
world compared to the java world.</p>

<p>So as an exercise I decided to see if I could make our prototype work
with jruby with the view of doing a test deployment on tomcat or some
other application server. One of the motivating reason for doing this
is to get access to the java based XML libraries for validation and
processing. It also means that if I can deploy to the same Tomcat server
where I&#39;m running SOLR and Fedora-Commons then it means I&#39;m saving myself
a chunk of work setting up and maintaining <em>mod_passenger</em>.</p>

<p>In short what I ended up doing was make sqlite3 as being dependent on
the ruby platform and creating a block for jruby. So here&#39;s the relevant
snippet from my <em>Gemfile</em></p>

<p>What I found was that jruby behaves oddly when I&#39;m behind a proxy, it
seems to blindly take my system proxy settings on my mac, so I had to
work around it.</p>

<p>Nokogiri seems to be subtly different when deployed with jruby and thus
it breaks a bunch of things, which is funny as this was the main reason
to testing out jruby so that we can access the java based XML libraries.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having a few days of time off from work I&#39;ve committed to migrating my
archlinux based laptops to using btrfs. I&#39;ve to date been just using
ext4 and nilfs2 (on an SD card) on my eeepc and plain old ext4 on the
bigger laptop.</p>

<p>The main motivation was that the two devices were pretty outdated and
I felt lucky with doing a major upgrade (replaced sysvinit with systemd
as recommended by the archlinux people)</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to reinstall my machines so I took the route of converting
the existing ext4 partitions to btrfs. I left my <em>/boot</em> partition as
ext2 for safety. Prior to converting to btrfs I had upgraded the two
laptops to using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Grub2">grub2</a>
first. I then proceeded to boot up my laptops with the
archlinux installer image via a usb key. Then just followed the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs">btrfs</a> documentation at
the archlinux wiki.</p>

<p>The process went more smoothly than I had anticipated, I didn&#39;t run into
any major stumbling blocks, that said I did have to free up some space
for the migration to occur.</p>

<p>Once the systems were back up and running I enabled compression on btrfs
and defragged the systems</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">find / -xdev -type f -print -exec btrfs filesystem defrag &#39;{}&#39; \;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This compression feature made a huge difference on the space limited
eeepc, the compression feature reclaimed about 10% of the space on the
system. It&#39;s a shame that the RHEL based distros aren&#39;t quite supporting
btrfs yet there are quite a few nice features there that are very
attractive for pro-consumers and the enterprise. RHEL7 will have btrfs,
hopefully there will be backports to RHEL6.</p>

<p>Performance wise I haven&#39;t used the system in anger yet, so time will
tell if I&#39;m happy with btrfs or not.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It was clear at this year&#39;s supercomputing conference that there wasn&#39;t
as much excitement as previous years. There wasn&#39;t much surprise as
nothing too revolutionary and radical was announced. In the past when
Bluegene/L and P arrived after the earth simulator there was an arms race
to being number 1 in the top500 list.  Even things like GPGPU&#39;s aren&#39;t
as cool anymore, everyone is selling effectively the same systems when
it comes to clusters. Not everyone has the budget to procure a specialist
machine like a NEC vector machine, a CRAY, Bluegene/Q etc&hellip;</p>

<p>The arms race to the top is just completely crazy, the top 50 or so
machines are so powerful compared to what a typical university or small
research lab might have access is too is completely skewed. At our site
we&#39;re probably about 0.5% of the top machine. In the past we were about
1-2% typically of the top machine, and we were about 5yrs behind the
curve. The top 500 list should really be renamed to the top 50 list and
the green 500 list or the HPCC list should be used instead as a measure
of the top machines in the world. Do people really think that LINPACK
is a good measure of how powerful a machine is going to be?</p>

<p>What was interesting at this year&#39;s conference was some of the papers
and panels were focused on project management and data management of
scientific datasets. I noticed that when people are starting to worry
about meta-data standards like librarians, people are starting to think
about archiving the data, they probably haven&#39;t thought about the access
component of preservation which will be amusing when they do realise
it. There is also a disconnect from some of the papers which focused on
silent data corruption at the storage and network layers. The archiving
and preservation space for HPC will need to deal with bit-flips, silent
data corruption, malicious users and all that funk that is related to it.</p>

<p>After having a few chats with some vendors during the week, /me eyes
them vendors. There seems to be a bit of a lack of understanding that
archiving and preservation of data isn&#39;t just about bulk, cheap and
reliable storage. There are apects to it which require data processing and
analytics of the data. It seems somewhat pointless to archive data and not
index it, process it and deliver it to who needs it. At somepoint the data
will be touched for checksumming, surrogate generation, delivery to the
end user. There also seems to be a lack of a guarantee of data-integrity
at the filesystem level. It appears that this responsiblity is left to
the application developer.</p>

<p>Would storage vendors (filesystems, devices the whole stack!) please
consider providing end to end data integrity? If the guys at the top are
trying to reach exascale computing in the next 5 years then the storage
component needs to catch up. Other sectors would also benefit from the
end to end data integrity built into storage systems.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having spent the best part of my Sunday afternoon playing with ansible
just to learn and see what all the fuss is about, I was pleasantly
surprised with it.</p>

<p>I had installed <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">ansible</a> on my OSX
laptop and <a href="https://github.com/ansible/vagrant-ansible">vagrant-ansible</a>
for my vagrant test environment.</p>

<p>The plan was to try and re-create my current ruby on rails development
and test virtual machine with vagrant. A secondary goal was to get it
to work with both Ubuntu Precise (LTS) and Scientific Linux 6.</p>

<p>My attempt at doing the above can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/tchpc-vagrant/tree/ansible">tchpc-vagrant</a>
in the ansible branch. You will need ansible installed on your host
machine. You don&#39;t need much installed in the target machine as ansible
is designed to login and execute commands as required, this is quite
refreshing. Compared to puppet and chef, if I were to roll this out
into production my overhead will be pretty low. This low overhead is
something that I really like as I don&#39;t need to setup an infrastructure
just to run puppet.</p>

<p>In short I was able to learn how ansible is supposed to work (I think)
and build up enough configuration to start up a vagrant vm with what I
need for to do rails development in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>One thing that did occur to me was the lack of windows support, given
that ansible is designed to use ssh to carry out its activities, finding
stock windows machines which run ssh is pretty slim. This is one area
which puppet (perhaps chef too) is better at. It&#39;s also one feature that
I would like as the vagrant vm&#39;s that we&#39;re using in work might be given
to windows users for testing and evaluation.</p>

<p>Going forward I think ansible will certainly be in my toolkit. There really is
a light on the otherside for mangement, deployment and orchestration.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve been eyeing <a href="https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar">crowbar</a>
recently, it looks pretty useful and interesting for deploying servers
and applications. I haven&#39;t seen much if at all any documentation out
there which suggests that people in the digital preservation and archiving
fields are implementing systems at scale, I&#39;m under the impression that
most systems/sites are building systems up one piece at a time without
much automation.</p>

<p>It seems to use <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef</a> in the backend for
all the automation. I&#39;ve been relearning <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>
recently so that I can have reproducible environments with
<a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<p>There might be an advantage to learn and port all the existing modules
that I have already created and configured to chef instead of puppet. If
I did move to a chef automation in my vagrant environments then a few
years from now when we go to full production we might be able to deploy
the whole system from bare metal relatively quickly and repeatably.</p>

<p>Automating the deployments will mean that we will have documentation
on the infrastructure itself. Either which way there is still a need
to automate the fedora-commons, SOLR, mysql and postgres deployments at
some point.</p>

<p>After all this thinking and pondering, I&#39;m still using puppet. There&#39;s
still the likes of ansible, cfengine, bcfg2 and juju. There is a never
ending supply of these tools.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>There&#39;s a new release of Ceph, I hope that they release a stable soon so we can
do further evaluations of the Ceph storage
system. A few of my work colleagues are going to the <a href="http://www.inktank.com/news-events/event/ceph-workshops-amsterdam/">Ceph
workshop</a>
next week.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone has taken the CRUSH algorithm and used it in other
domains.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>What do you do when you need a crash course on RoR, Hydra and frameworks for
digital preservation and archiving? You go to Hydracamp!</p>

<p>The syllabus was</p>

<ul>
<li>Day 1 - Rails, CRUD, TDD and Git</li>
<li>Day 2 - Collaborative development with Stories, Tickets, TDD and Git</li>
<li>Day 3 - Hydra, Fedora, XML and RDF (ActiveFedora and OM)</li>
<li>Day 4 - SOLR and Blacklight</li>
<li>Day 5 - Hydra-head, Hydra Access Controls</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the training sessions were hands on from day 1 which was
refreshing, as it was hands on I getting the most out of the training
session. It would have been better if I had known more ruby to move
along some of the exercises more effectively.</p>

<p>To give an overview of what we had done (between ~30 people), we created
a ruby on rails application titled &ldquo;Twitter for Zombies&rdquo;. With this small
application everybody was frantically committing, pulling, merging and
pushing code. It was highly informative and a good learning experience
to see how fast things could move.</p>

<p>The training session also included a crash course into what Fedora and
SOLR does and how Hydra interacts with these components. The third and
fourth days were the most interesting as it showed how someone might
convert from a typical RoR application into an application which uses
Fedora as the persistance layer. The last day was really just a wrap up
and Q&amp;A session.</p>

<p>You could take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/projecthydra">github</a>
account for Project Hydra and have a peek at the hydracamp repo.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I shall be going to SC2012 next month, I plan on hitting a few of the
storage vendors for possible collaborations and flagging to them that
we&#39;re on the look out for storage systems. One of the first
observation that the reader will note is &ldquo;where is that link between
HPC and Digital Preservation and Archiving&rdquo;. It&#39;s probably not obvious
to most people, one of the big problems in the area of preservation
and archiving is the the amount of data involved and the varied types
of data. This is not taking into account of the issues with data
access patterns.</p>

<p>Given that a preservation and archiving project will want to provide a
trusted system, the system will want to read out every single byte
that was put in to verify that the data is correct at somepoint
(usually with some form of hashing).</p>

<p>Reading data out and checking that it&#39;s correct serially probably
isn&#39;t the smartest solution. Nor is copying the data into 2-3
locations (where each site is maintaining 2-3 copies for backups and
redundancy). The current and seemingly most popular solutions is to
dump the data to a few offsite locations (such as S3 or SWIFT)
compatible storage systems, then just hoping for the best that if
anyone of the sites is down or corrupted there site can be restored
from the other sites or from a backup. I need to delve deeper into the
storage and data-distribution strategies that some of the bigger
projects are taking. There has to be a smarter way of storing and
preserving data without having to make copies of things.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often wondered how projects manage to copy/move data across
storage providers in a reasonable amount of time without needing to
wheel a few racks of disks around. It would also be interesting to see
the error rates of these systems and how often errors are
corrected. If they are corrected what is the computational cost of
doing this.</p>

<p>If you have a multi-terabyte archive the problem isn&#39;t too bad, the
more typical case these days might be in the order of the low hundreds
of terabytes. I could only imagine what lager scale sites must deal
with. I&#39;m still not a fan of moving a problem from a local site to a
remote site as it often shows that there is a lack of understanding to
the problem. Storage in the preservation and archiving domain will
probably turn into an IO and compute intensive operation at some
point, especially if you want to do something with the data.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>A co-worker of mine (Paddy Doyle) had originally hacked at a perl script
for reporting balances from SLURM&#39;s accounting system a year or two ago
and he had figured out that it might be possible to do some minimalistic
&#39;configuration&#39; and scripting to get a system that&#39;s very basic but
functional.</p>

<p>It was just one of those things that funding agencies wanted to justify
how the system was being used, GOLD was clunky and obtrusive and
complicated for what we wanted. Most of all we liked SLURM but not GOLD
and Maui which was needed to get full accounting and banking (most of
the features weren&#39;t used).</p>

<p>Being good and lazy engineers we got excited with the prospect of having
the option of replacing SLURM, Maui and GOLD with just plain old SLURM
we set out to write down the workflows for what we wanted to do and what
the user and funding agencies actually wanted. With those ideas in mind
we set out to implement as much as we could and needed in just plain
old sh/bash scripting with a splash of perl. Replacing two components
with one meant that we would have less work to do in the long run ;)</p>

<p>After a whole year of running with these scripts and just putting it
online, I&#39;ve noticed that there may be a few sites out there that might
be using our scripts and workflows. It would be nice to find out how
many people are using our implementation of a banking system in SLURM
and if it&#39;s driven by sysadmins looking to account for usage or is it
funding agencies looking for justification of the usage of a system.</p>

<p>I was going to be at the SLURM User Group Meeting 2012 to give a
short talk on our experiences with the SLURM-Bank scripts and workflow,
but sadly I have to be in the US during this meeting and my colleague
&ldquo;Paddy Doyle&rdquo; will there instead of me.  I would have liked to go and chat
with the developers of SLURM to push for more advanced banking/accounting
facilities in SLURM itself. Visiting BSC again would have been fun.</p>
