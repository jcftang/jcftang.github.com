<div class="entry-content"><p>Over past few weeks I&#8217;ve been working on doing some integration and
testing work to try and deliver a prototype system. I&#8217;ve taken the
<a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> tool and puppet to try and deliver
systems for testing and development. Although the systems that I am
currently working with aren&#8217;t fully automated, they are automated
enough for them to be easily started up by a developer who reads the
documentation (I hope).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that by providing these disposable systems that the various
members in the team that I am working with will be more free to experiment
and less fearful of breaking the system. At best everyone will take the
idea on board and run with it as it does provide a common environment
for all members in the team and it encourages reproducibility of issues
and features.</p>

<p>One of the next steps of building up the development framework that I
now have is to introduce some of these concepts and the whole Vagrant
environment to the more front facing part of the team who need to deal
with stakeholders in the project. If our requirements and policy team have
constant up to date access to our development, testing and QA environment
along with the executable specifications (in the form of cucumber tests)
I hope to push forward communications between the stakeholders and the
team that I&#8217;m working with.</p>

<p>For now I have one VM for the application itself and a number of
&#8220;clusters&#8221; of VM&#8217;s which I had used for reviewing some technical
documentation, they are partially automated for others to
play with. Currently these scripts are internal to the project
only, but it&#8217;s not hard to setup if you know how to configure
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>. Some of the scripts and ideas can
be found at <a href="https://github.com/jcftang/tchpc-vagrant">tchpc-vagrant</a>,
they&#8217;re not great, but not bad either. I need more of the developers in
the team to use what I&#8217;ve setup to evolve the system more for our use.</p>

<p>In parallel to using this for my day job, I&#8217;ve
also setup a Vagrantfile for one of my pet projects
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/cports">cports</a>. Using Vagrant for testing
builds and deployments of a packaging system has been great. I&#8217;ve been
able to do clean rebuilds of various packages without fear of completely
polluting the enviroment, as its just a few commands away from being
redeployed and provisioned. I&#8217;ll need to play more and then release it
to the HPC community (or those that care).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a long time consumer of ruby applications but never quite
got around to learning the language and the frameworks that are
available to developers. Within the team that I have been working
with, we&#8217;ve been evaluating <a href="http://projecthydra.org">hydra</a> as a
possible framework for our project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been spending the last few days reading
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a>, I&#8217;ve
been able to pick up some of the basic syntax of the language from the
BDD book. As soon as I finish this book I will be moving on to a more
real world book relating to ruby with the goal of being able to
develop Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t get as far as finishing the RSpec book and I&#8217;ve started
creating a rubygem. I&#8217;m attempting to expose the insides of
<a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/zfec/">zfec</a>, specifically the
functionality in <em>fec.c</em>. So far I&#8217;ve been lazy and I am using swig to
automatically generate the C to ruby bindings with something like this</p>

<p>Swig does it&#8217;s thing,</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Amazingly after some fiddling I got ruby to load up the module. It
doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to do much though as I need to learn
about the typemaps in the ruby C interface do the correct mappings.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so far taking inspiration from the zfec python module to take a
stab at building a ruby equivalent package for the sake of learning
ruby and maybe even end up with something useful for the project that
I am working on in work.</p>

<p>After playing with extending ruby, I&#8217;m thinking I may need to take a
step back and evaluate if this is the best way for me to learn ruby or
not. I should probably not mess too much extending the language with a
C library.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having discovered <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</a> recently at OR2012 I&#8217;ve
been building a few <em>boxes</em> for our site for testing purposes. I&#8217;ve
had to relearn puppet to provision machines, but it&#8217;s paying off. I&#8217;ve
been able to deploy 3-4 virtual machines with relative ease.</p>

<p>The only disappointment is the seemingly frequent and semi-random
kernel panics and crashes that I get on OSX (which is probably caused
by VirtualBox when I do lots of IO). It&#8217;s making me rethink if I
really want to stick with OSX as my primary desktop OS in work. I may
have to revert back to using Linux at somepoint.</p>

<p>At least in Linux I know how to get a kdump out and debug the issue
but with OSX I&#8217;m not sure where I should begin to figure out what&#8217;s
broken.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I only discovered <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant">Vagrant</a> last
week at OR2012 when one of the presentations had Vagrant as a part of
the testing component in the project. I was pleasantly surprised that
it was leaveraging lots of free and opensource technology to provide
repeatable environments for development and testing. I was even more
impressed by the <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">Veewee</a> project
which provides some additional wrappers for building custom
&#8216;boxes&#8217;. Veewee certainly saved me lots of time in setting up some
updated <a href="http://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a> boxes
(it&#8217;s my preferred distro for deployments).</p>

<p>In summary Vagrant is a set of scripts to manage virtual machines and
Veewee is a set of scripts for creating base images for use in
Vagrant. If you&#8217;re interested in the updated SL6.2 definitions they
can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/veewee/tree/scientificlinux-6.2">fork of veewee</a>.</p>

<p>All that is left now is to setup <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a> and
have it automatically provision my development/test environment. I&#8217;m
not a huge fan of puppet, but I guess it&#8217;s better than rolling my own.</p>

<p>I look forward to have the capability of having easy access to
disposable VM&#8217;s for prototyping and testing! I will need to at
somepoint setup a test system for cports with this tool.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I finally had gotten back from the conference late in the evening on
Friday, airport security was not fun at all. It was the first Open
Repositories conference that I had attended, the community seems to be
pretty tightly knit. There were two or three software stacks which
were presented that looked useful.  Things such as Fedora-Commons,
Hydra and a few other sub-components which were talked about are going
to be likely building blocks that we will be using for our Digital
Repository.</p>

<p>There was also a developer challenge which I decided to enter at the
last minute, it was both a new and interesting experience at
presenting something that wasn&#8217;t well prepared to an audience that I
had no experience with either. By the way, I was a team of one! I had
proposed the idea that replicating data can be expensive and bad,
there are alternatives to just copying files around en-mass and
storing replicas left right and centre.</p>

<p>I promised I would post some photos, but it seems my photos aren&#8217;t as
interesting as the ones that other people took. See
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/or2012/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/or2012/</a>.</p>

<p>Next year Open Repositories will be held in Prince Edward Island,
Canada. I will need to be better prepared next year (assuming I go).</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I only been here for a day and Edinburgh is as nice as I recall it
was. This time my attendance to Open Repositories 2012 brought me and
some co-workers of the DRI team to this city. It&#8217;s my first time at
this event and there seems to be lots of people, so far it&#8217;s been
pleasant enough apart from the weather.</p>

<p>For those interested in whats happening you should follow the hashtag
<strong><em>#or2012</em></strong> on twitter to see what people are saying. One of the cool
thing was they gave out 8gb USB memory sticks (built into the name
cards), I thought that was a nice touch.</p>

<p>So far it&#8217;s two thumbs up for the organisers. It&#8217;s only workshops for
far, I look forward to the poster sessions and other talks which will
be on. Day 2 will be more workshops and poster sessions, plus a
keynote.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>As an exercise of a Friday afternoon of not starting something big before
heading off to a conference. I&#8217;ve decided to spend an hour or two at
seeing how ceph is installed and configured on an SL6 based machine
(RHEL6 clone).</p>

<p>The install target is just an old desktop running a 64bit install of SL6x,
so it&#8217;s nothing too fancy.</p>

<p>Following the instructions at <a href="http://ceph.com/wiki/Installing_on_RedHat_or_CentOS">http://ceph.com/wiki/Installing_on_RedHat_or_CentOS</a>, I ended up doing this</p>

<pre><code>yum install yum-conf-epel
yum update
yum gcc gcc-c++ automake libtool expat expat-devel boost-devel nss-devel cryptopp cryptopp-devel libatomic_ops-devel fuse-devel
yum install libedit-devel libedit
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the packages <em>cryptopp-devel</em>, <em>cryptopp</em> and <em>expat-devel</em>,
<em>expat</em> are the only packages pulled in from the epel repository.</p>

<p>Additional libraries and tools include these weren&#8217;t mentioned in the
upstream wiki, the upstream wiki probably needs to be updated.</p>

<pre><code>yum install rpm-build
yum install libaio-devel libcurl-devel libxml2-devel libuuid-devel keyutils-libs-devel fcgi-devel
</code></pre>

<p>I chose to install the newly designated stable branch of ceph 0.48argonaut</p>

<pre><code>wget http://ceph.com/download/ceph-0.48argonaut.tar.bz2
</code></pre>

<p>I also chose to build it in RPM form, in the tarball there is a RPM spec
file which can be used to create an installable RPM, the following is
a transcript of what I did to build an installable RPM.</p>

<pre><code>tar xjvf ceph-0.48argonaut.tar.bz2
cp ceph-0.48argonaut.tar.bz2 ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
rpmbuild -ba ceph-0.48argonaut/ceph.spec
</code></pre>

<p>The build will take <em>some</em> time, especially if you are using old
hardware. I ran into some minor packaging issues,</p>

<pre><code>diff -u ceph.spec.in.orig ceph.spec.in

</code></pre>

<p>The above change need&#8217;s to be applied to the <em>ceph</em> spec file for the
RPM(s) to build successfully.</p>

<pre><code>ceph-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
ceph-devel-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
python-ceph-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm

libcephfs1-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
ceph-fuse-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>I chose to install <em>all</em> the RPM&#8217;s that were generated for educational
purposes (used yum instead of the rpm commands so the dependancies are
sorted out for me), from the <em>rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64</em> directory</p>

<pre><code>yum install ceph-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm ceph-devel-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm ceph-fuse-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm ceph-radosgw-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm libcephfs1-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm librados2-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm librbd1-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm python-ceph-0.48argonaut-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>I then simply followed the 5 minute quick start guide at
<a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start/">http://ceph.com/docs/master/start/quick-start/</a> to see if ceph would
start up. There is more documentation at <a href="http://ceph.com/docs/master">http://ceph.com/docs/master</a>
that I have yet to go through. Perhaps the configuration of ceph can go
into another post.</p>

<p>To start the cluster after it&#8217;s configured</p>

<pre><code>service ceph -a start
</code></pre>

<p>However on my test system it&#8217;s currently crashing out with the mds server giving the followin errors</p>

<pre><code>2012-07-06 16:38:17.838055 7f2d6828d700 -1 mds.-1.0 *** got signal Terminated ***

<p>I&#8217;ve logged the error message on the ceph-devel mailing list, I don&#8217;t
have time to poke at this problem right now. I need to recreate this
scenario in a VM on my laptop so I can play with this on the plane when
I&#8217;m going to Open Repositories 2012 this weekend.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Having happily running and using both git-annex and tahoe-lafs in the
past year or so to manage my files and backups. I&#8217;ve been thinking
about plugging in tahoe-lafs as a backend driver for iRODS. I never
quite got around to doing it properly, I had only gotten the universal
mass storage driver to talk to tahoe-lafs. I was planning on writing
an MSO driver for iRODS to talk to tahoe-lafs&#8217;s web-api, but alas I
never got around to it. I need to get some interns to do it next year!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still highly attractive to have tahoe-lafs at the storage backend
due to its erasure coding capabilities to maximise a return on
investment in the storage infrastructure. I&#8217;m not sure if anyone has
really tried to use something like tahoe-lafs as a backend for digital
preservation.</p>

<p>There are a few niggling issues with tahoe-lafs which may prevent one
from using it in digital preservation, one is the lack of
precedence. Someone needs to take a first step at trying to see if it
works or not. Personally I would like to see the multi-introducer work
to be production ready and released, this would hugely increase the
availability of a tahoe-lafs grid and would mitigate the need for
trying make one introducer node highly available and redundant and of
course local network performance could be better. I&#8217;ve never really
been able to get more than 10-20mbit/s out of a download/upload. If my
transfers are queued up and running in the background it&#8217;s not a major
issue.</p>

<p>Which brings me to git-annex, all the new fancy features that the
author of git-annex has been adding has been fantastic. I&#8217;ve setup a
&#8220;target&#8221; which is a tahoe-lafs grid which I use a replica set for one
of my annex&#8217;d collection of files. It&#8217;s not the fastest thing in the
world for transfers but at least I know my data is safe in at least
two places.</p>

<p>Having used git-annex happily for the past while and being interested
in the S3 and SWIFT interfaces that git-annex is able to talk to has
made me wonder if it&#8217;s a good idea to try and create a fedora-commons
backend/remote for git-annex or a real tahoe-lafs backend/remote that
doesn&#8217;t rely on the general hook system that git-annex already
has. Also the Internet Archive provides an S3/SWIFT like interface.</p>

<p>Or would it be better to go the other way around and try using
git-annex as a type of interface to other backend storage systems for
fedora-commons, I wish I had more time to poke the akubra
interface/package in fedora-commons.</p>

<p>The above is just a rant and my brain spewing random stuff out in the
afternoon after thinking about the OR2012 developer challenge.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been eyeing this Ceph storage system for a while for a number of
potential uses, it looks like its finally ready for production usage.</p>

<p>It is a pitty that the cephfs component isn&#8217;t recommended for
production usage yet. Still, Ceph is really going to shake up the
distributed storage industry. Having used GPFS, Lustre and a few other
systems in production in the past, Ceph certainly looks attractive.</p>
