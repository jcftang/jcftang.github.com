<p>I haven&#8217;t tried installing it from the npm repository yet, I assume
that they will work. There&#8217;s still some cosmetic work (needs to be
branded correctly) that needs to be done as well as lots of error
checking, validation and testing. It&#8217;s not a bad place to be starting
to look for ideas if you are interested in building your own system to
interface with Fedora Commons.</p>

<p>Just remember the above is just a prototype that we thought would be
good to share with the world!.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>The event was actually on 2012-06-06 and it was invite only. The event
was mostly about the infrastructure of Facebook. It was actually done
quite tastefully with a main speaker giving an overview of the whole
system. Luckily they did not turn the event into a recruitment event
which was quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the posters that I had actually want to see and
chat to the engineers involved wasn&#8217;t there, there were enough
engineers around for me to harass with questions.</p>

<p>This event was also the first event that I have been to in Dublin
which required an NDA, that was sort of strange. Some people that I
know didn&#8217;t attend as a result of the NDA.</p>

<p>All in all Facebook does have some pretty cool tech internally (like
all the other big dotcom companies). Some of it is even opensource!</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a> is in the process of
getting <strong>git-annex assistant</strong> crowd funded. I had not been keeping
up to date too much in the last year with git-annex partly because it
met my needs and I never needed to upgrade to the latest tip.</p>

<p>There are a number of really cool features now which is making
git-annex more accessible. I particularly like how the merge and sync
workflows have now been pretty much <em>scripted</em> so there is less to go
wrong!</p>

<p>Once the <strong>Dropbox</strong> like features get implemented git-annex will be
pretty interesting, it won&#8217;t be a complete <em>clone</em> of Dropbox due to
the way that git-annex deals with files (using symlinks), it will be a
pretty good alternative to Dropbox. I wish <em>smudge filters</em> were on
the roadmap as well.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>After almost 3 months supervising and working with two interns I&#8217;ve
finally uploaded their work under the GPLv2 License.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>Please note that the packages above do not represent DRI at all, they
just ended up getting labelled that way for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So what are the above packages? Well they are an attempt at creating a
workflow for the DRIS team in TCD who work on digital preservation,
digitisation, cataloging and a host of other tasks which I probably
don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>The prototype system consists of the DRIS Workflows package and the
API server. The system currently target the problem of ingesting
objects. It tries to map what the librarians/archivists at TCD are
doing to a single interface to increase throughput and quality of the
work (amongst other things).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also able to export the internal meta-data as Dublin-Core, it&#8217;s
not great right now and requires more work and there is a small start
made on MODS as well. It does demonstrate what the interns managed to
achieve in 3 months time with a loose spec on what needed to be
done. The basic design and architecture of the system isn&#8217;t too
different from Hydra, it was very much by accident that we ended up
some similar ideas.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this post is to share the code! and as per
usual, hope someone finds it useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on <em>ceph</em> for quite sometime now. It looks
like <em>ceph</em> is almost ready for production usage. There is now a
support infrastructure and a commercial company backing the
product. So far the OSD, MDS and MON components all run on Linux since
most of the implementation appears to be in the user land I wonder if
it will be ported to non-linux platforms. It&#8217;s be quite nifty if one
could have a heterogeneous network of servers providing storage.</p>

<p>From first glance at shadowing one of the guys in work with this
filesystem, it looks good. It&#8217;s missing some documentation right now
apart from that it&#8217;s going to be a great competitor in the distributed
filesystems arena. It will shake up GPFS and Lustre for sure, it might
even give glusterfs a run for its money in the near future.</p>

  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In the world of digital preservation and repositories it seems that
there is primarily fedora-commons, dspace, eprints and one or two
other solutions out there for building up digital preservation
systems. The one that really stands out as a framework and toolkit for
building bigger and more complex systems is fedora-commons.</p>

<p>It also happens to be written in JAVA and is a fairly big and complex
system which implements best-practices for storing digital objects
with the sole purpose of preservation. In one of the projects that I
have been working with some interns at work; we have treated
fedora-commons as just storage system where we interface to the
preservation repository via the available REST api.</p>

<p>By using the API it was possible to use node.js to implement the
servers which contained all the business logic. Project Hydra does
something similar or rather we are doing something similar to Project
Hydra, by accident much to my suprise. Hydra uses Ruby on Rails for
its middleware implementation, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much JAVA
there either.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that this decoupled approach with REST servers and
clients to be pretty attractive to anyone who wishes to implement
these types systems. It is interesting to see that the applications
aren&#8217;t being written in JAVA. At least that is what I can see with the
projects that use Hydra (which is sort of the point). Maybe good
enough practice is fine for most use cases.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how many digital preservation projects out there
really use 100% JAVA up to delivery to the client? How many projects
out there are really just mashups of different types of technology
(well planned mashups). Is it because of &#8220;best practice&#8221; for
implementing enterprise applications that JAVA gets so much focus and
attention?</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that <a href="git://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree.git">git-subtree</a>
has been merged into the mainline git project. <em>git-subtree</em> is one of
those really useful wrappers for manipulating git repositories if you
are an integrator or don&#8217;t really like git-submodule. It certainly is
a nicer alternative to git-submodule. There is less chance of the
person cloning a git-subtree repository messing up the checkout because
they forgot to initialise the submodules. There is also the added
advantage of not needing to fiddle around scripting up the git-archive
commands for exporting the source tree for a release if you use
git-subtree; actually git-subtree is just plain useful.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This tool hasn&#8217;t been around for too long, but long enough to make it
into quite a few distros. It looks like it&#8217;s a good alternative to
<em>autossh</em> and <em>tmux</em> which I have been using for the past few
years. Like many new tools like this, if it&#8217;s not around everywhere
it&#8217;s not as useful as it could be.</p>

<p>The only minor criticism of the application is that the <em>mosh</em> command
itself is written in perl, it would be nicer if the wrapper command
would be written in C/C++ like the rest of the application. It would
certainly make it more <em>portable</em>. I guess I should shut up or write
my own mosh wrapper replacement.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#8217;ve got it installed on one or two machines and it
seems nice enough so far. I now need to test it out in the field on a
bad connection when I&#8217;m away at a team meeting. I&#8217;m still not entirely
sure of how good or bad it is in terms of security compared to <em>SSH</em>.</p>
