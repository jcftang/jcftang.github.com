      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The event was actually on 2012-06-06 and it was invite only. The event
was mostly about the infrastructure of Facebook. It was actually done
quite tastefully with a main speaker giving an overview of the whole
system. Luckily they did not turn the event into a recruitment event
which was quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the posters that I had actually want to see and
chat to the engineers involved wasn&#8217;t there, there were enough
engineers around for me to harass with questions.</p>

<p>This event was also the first event that I have been to in Dublin
which required an NDA, that was sort of strange. Some people that I
know didn&#8217;t attend as a result of the NDA.</p>

<p>All in all Facebook does have some pretty cool tech internally (like
all the other big dotcom companies). Some of it is even opensource!</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a> is in the process of
getting <strong>git-annex assistant</strong> crowd funded. I had not been keeping
up to date too much in the last year with git-annex partly because it
met my needs and I never needed to upgrade to the latest tip.</p>

<p>There are a number of really cool features now which is making
git-annex more accessible. I particularly like how the merge and sync
workflows have now been pretty much <em>scripted</em> so there is less to go
wrong!</p>

<p>Once the <strong>Dropbox</strong> like features get implemented git-annex will be
pretty interesting, it won&#8217;t be a complete <em>clone</em> of Dropbox due to
the way that git-annex deals with files (using symlinks), it will be a
pretty good alternative to Dropbox. I wish <em>smudge filters</em> were on
the roadmap as well.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After almost 3 months supervising and working with two interns I&#8217;ve
finally uploaded their work under the GPLv2 License.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>Please note that the packages above do not represent DRI at all, they
just ended up getting labelled that way for whatever reason.</p>

<p>So what are the above packages? Well they are an attempt at creating a
workflow for the DRIS team in TCD who work on digital preservation,
digitisation, cataloging and a host of other tasks which I probably
don&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>The prototype system consists of the DRIS Workflows package and the
API server. The system currently target the problem of ingesting
objects. It tries to map what the librarians/archivists at TCD are
doing to a single interface to increase throughput and quality of the
work (amongst other things).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also able to export the internal meta-data as Dublin-Core, it&#8217;s
not great right now and requires more work and there is a small start
made on MODS as well. It does demonstrate what the interns managed to
achieve in 3 months time with a loose spec on what needed to be
done. The basic design and architecture of the system isn&#8217;t too
different from Hydra, it was very much by accident that we ended up
some similar ideas.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this post is to share the code! and as per
usual, hope someone finds it useful.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on <em>ceph</em> for quite sometime now. It looks
like <em>ceph</em> is almost ready for production usage. There is now a
support infrastructure and a commercial company backing the
product. So far the OSD, MDS and MON components all run on Linux since
most of the implementation appears to be in the user land I wonder if
it will be ported to non-linux platforms. It&#8217;s be quite nifty if one
could have a heterogeneous network of servers providing storage.</p>

<p>From first glance at shadowing one of the guys in work with this
filesystem, it looks good. It&#8217;s missing some documentation right now
apart from that it&#8217;s going to be a great competitor in the distributed
filesystems arena. It will shake up GPFS and Lustre for sure, it might
even give glusterfs a run for its money in the near future.</p>

<id>http://jcftang.github.com/blog/2012/05/16/is-java-really-the-only-game-in-town-for-building-digital-preservation-systems</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the world of digital preservation and repositories it seems that
there is primarily fedora-commons, dspace, eprints and one or two
other solutions out there for building up digital preservation
systems. The one that really stands out as a framework and toolkit for
building bigger and more complex systems is fedora-commons.</p>

<p>It also happens to be written in JAVA and is a fairly big and complex
system which implements best-practices for storing digital objects
with the sole purpose of preservation. In one of the projects that I
have been working with some interns at work; we have treated
fedora-commons as just storage system where we interface to the
preservation repository via the available REST api.</p>

<p>By using the API it was possible to use node.js to implement the
servers which contained all the business logic. Project Hydra does
something similar or rather we are doing something similar to Project
Hydra, by accident much to my suprise. Hydra uses Ruby on Rails for
its middleware implementation, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much JAVA
there either.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that this decoupled approach with REST servers and
clients to be pretty attractive to anyone who wishes to implement
these types systems. It is interesting to see that the applications
aren&#8217;t being written in JAVA. At least that is what I can see with the
projects that use Hydra (which is sort of the point). Maybe good
enough practice is fine for most use cases.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how many digital preservation projects out there
really use 100% JAVA up to delivery to the client? How many projects
out there are really just mashups of different types of technology
(well planned mashups). Is it because of &#8220;best practice&#8221; for
implementing enterprise applications that JAVA gets so much focus and
attention?</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems that <a href="git://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree.git">git-subtree</a>
has been merged into the mainline git project. <em>git-subtree</em> is one of
those really useful wrappers for manipulating git repositories if you
are an integrator or don&#8217;t really like git-submodule. It certainly is
a nicer alternative to git-submodule. There is less chance of the
person cloning a git-subtree repository messing up the checkout because
they forgot to initialise the submodules. There is also the added
advantage of not needing to fiddle around scripting up the git-archive
commands for exporting the source tree for a release if you use
git-subtree; actually git-subtree is just plain useful.</p>

<id>http://jcftang.github.com/blog/2012/04/17/mosh-an-alternative-to-ssh</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This tool hasn&#8217;t been around for too long, but long enough to make it
into quite a few distros. It looks like it&#8217;s a good alternative to
<em>autossh</em> and <em>tmux</em> which I have been using for the past few
years. Like many new tools like this, if it&#8217;s not around everywhere
it&#8217;s not as useful as it could be.</p>

<p>The only minor criticism of the application is that the <em>mosh</em> command
itself is written in perl, it would be nicer if the wrapper command
would be written in C/C++ like the rest of the application. It would
certainly make it more <em>portable</em>. I guess I should shut up or write
my own mosh wrapper replacement.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#8217;ve got it installed on one or two machines and it
seems nice enough so far. I now need to test it out in the field on a
bad connection when I&#8217;m away at a team meeting. I&#8217;m still not entirely
sure of how good or bad it is in terms of security compared to <em>SSH</em>.</p>

<updated>2012-04-09T11:12:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://jcftang.github.com/blog/2012/04/09/prototyping-and-testing-systems</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the issues with with dogfooding your own projects to accelerate
development might be the lack of control and feedback from the
specifications and requirements process. To try and mitigate this
effect, automated testing should be done, that is specification,
feature and behavioural testing. Call it what you will, but the basic
idea is to get a common understanding between the stakeholder, project
owner and developer to understand what is being built and to write
automated tests collectively to ensure that it is being
delivered. This might be a narrow view of the whole area, but I&#8217;m just
taking what works for me and using it to deliver the project.</p>

<p>There are <em>many</em> specification/feature/behavioural testing tools out
there for almost language that you can think of, so use what works for
you and your team. The testing process not only ensures that the
prototype is working the way that you intend, but it is also a process
where documentation can also be written at the sametime. This
documentation could be used as an initial proposal to the stakeholder
to put forward what you think they want if there are no clear
specifications or requirements in place.</p>

<p>The interns and I have been working on a small prototype system
for a bigger project and the benefits of writing tests are beginning
to show. It has become apparent to the interns that have been working
on this project that <em>testing is a good thing</em>, especially if it can
be automated. We&#8217;re not quite doing TDD or BDD, but it&#8217;s something
that is in between, we&#8217;re getting there with a tiered set of tests.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re finding that (probably) about 50% of the time of the team is
spent on refactoring, writing tests and documentation. Testing
combined with the automated builder/tester, the team is writing code
smarter and better instead of just churning out masses of code which
isn&#8217;t well tested or documented. Given the choice and based on
experience I would prefer to have code that is tested and
documentated, rather than lots of cool half-working and half-tested
features.</p>

<p>The testing process has been a fantastic way for me to steer the
interns, given how little expertise I have with javascript. The tests
let me learn how the interns have been putting the prototype together,
but it also lets me fuzz up the tests to make sure things are working
and to also write new tests to communicate what I think is needed when
appropriate. We&#8217;ve somewhat combined minimal QA into the development
and testing process.</p>

<p>In the end we hope to have a functional prototype system which does
one thing (one set of workflows) well, have lots of documentation,
have tests to back it up and prove that it works. While having an
implementation is great for the potential stakeholder, having
documentation and tests puts us in an even stronger position.</p>

<link href="https://github.com/jcftang/gitbuilder/tree/develop/contrib/gitbuilder-ajax"/>
<updated>2012-04-01T11:05:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://jcftang.github.com/blog/2012/04/01/gitbuilder-aggregator</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We use git and <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/gitbuilder">gitbuilder</a> in
work for a large number of projects, we also try and test things as
much as we can. I first noticed that someone had written an aggregator
for gitbuilder at <a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/gitbuilder.cgi">ceph
gitbuilders</a>, this seemed
like a great idea (and it is) except the aggregator at the time didn&#8217;t
quite work very fast and needed some ajax magic.</p>

<p>I had asked for a copy of the aggregator script from the ceph
developers, this was really just a perl hack as they said, but it
works. Since we had some students doing an internship here to learn
new things, I got one of the interns to write an ajax&#8217;d up version of
the aggregator.</p>

<p>After a few weeks worth of usage and minor changes, it&#8217;s a bit more
ready to share with everyone, the ajax&#8217;d up version of the aggregator
can be found at my
<a href="https://github.com/jcftang/gitbuilder/tree/develop/contrib/gitbuilder-ajax">github</a>
account in the develop branch. For fun I updated the main gitbuilder
cgi scripts to use twitter bootstrap and add a link to the errcache
file that gitbuilder generates.</p>

<p>We found that with large builds the logs would just swamp out the
errors and warnings and having access to the errcache helped a lot in
narrowing down where to look for problems, hence the linking to the
errcache.</p>

<p>At somepoint it might be worth re-implementing the gitbuilder scripts
in a single language in a generic way such that it works with other
DVCS&#8217;s that have the bisect feature.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Should you dogfood your own project that you are developing? The
answer is probably yes, especially if you have no clear cut
requirements from the stakeholder in a project with a greenfield for
development. There is a lot to be said about having a working
implementation that can be presented and refined.</p>

<p>Sometimes the project that you are working on won&#8217;t have clear
requirements for implementation, so you should probably take basic
assumed cases and run with it. Starting early to see what works and
what doesn&#8217;t work is a pragmatic approach which the waterfall crowd
might not like. But hey, an implementation speaks for itself.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t use what you develop, then it is very hard to relate to
the customer/end-user in the long run. On the note of dogfooding your
own work, sometimes best-practice might cost too much in terms of time
and money, sometimes good-enough practice might just be enough to
deliver a functioning product.</p>

<p>Accelerating development by dogfooding your own work and using
good-enough practices should increase throughput of development, but
not necessarily quality. Again in a greenfield project where there
aren&#8217;t many requirements due to the schedule, it&#8217;s worth taking this
approach until hard requirements get delivered.</p>

useful. But it&#8217;s not enabled by default in Octopress.</p>

<p>This feature already exists in jekyll, enabling this feature in
Octopress is a trival task.</p>

<p>Firstly add this to your <code>_config.yml</code> file</p>

<pre><code>lsi: true
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a file such as <code>source/_includes/custom/asides/related.html</code> with the following
content, add it to one of your asides in <code>_config.yml</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Related Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul class="posts"&gt;
    {% for post in site.related_posts limit:5 %}
    &lt;li class="related"&gt;
        &lt;a href="{{ root_url }}{{ post.url }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    {% endfor %}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to style the list, but in the above I have chosen to
keep the same style as the recent posts.</p>

<h2>Probable issues with enabling LSI</h2>

<p>There are some issues with enabling LSI in jekyll/octopress, the
primary issue will be performance. The default implementation will be
slow if you have lots of posts to classify. It would be recommended
that rb-gsl be installed to accelerate the classification process.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is just a temporary solution till something better or more
appropriate comes along. It&#8217;s just an ikiwiki news aggregator for
websites and projects which are related to Digital Preservation,
Digitial Humanities and other related bits and pieces.</p>

<p>It was pretty much setup for myself to keep up to date with all the
latest happenings. I found myself falling behind in being
knowledgeable in all things related to <em>Digital Repositories Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>I hope that my team mates will appreciate and contribute to this
little effort. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever come across a Digital
Humanities and Digital Preservation aggregator before.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past few months, in my spare time whenever I get a chance, I&#8217;ve
been working on a side project in work. It&#8217;s a research project
amongst a group of people with a cool idea. The idea is to apply
neural networks to identifying diseases, populations and traits via
machine learning/supervised learning. I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the
application of the technology as to how new or revolutionary it is,
but it seems sensible that a machine is going to be very good at being
taught how to recognise patterns so why not do it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not directly responsible for the code for this paper, but I did go
back and refactor most of the code in an attempt to make it a little
presentable to the world and also much faster as a result. I hope that
the source code will eventually see the light of day.</p>

<p>Note, I am not the primary author of this presentation/paper, I just
have an interest in the idea, code and enjoy learning and playing with
this research.</p>

<p>There will be a presentation at
<a href="http://www.genepi.med.uni-goettingen.de/download/EMGM2012_Preliminary_Programme.pdf">EMGM</a>,
I will be curious as to what people think. Is it a crazy good or a
crazy bad idea? The data that is being generated is apparently good,
though personally I would like to see more analysis being done with
additional ANN&#8217;s or SVM&#8217;s to verify that it really is working as
expected.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can convince a CS or a Maths summer student to
re-implement the algorithm with a different ANN or SVM library. There
are a rake of ideas that I have that I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing
implemented. I just need more time!</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Team meetings can be both productive and counter productive as most
people find. If they are well structured with a purpose and goal then
a lot can be achieved (most of the time).</p>

<p>For explorartory meetings, it&#8217;s probably okay to have some time set
aside for some free and open discussions. Once a goal has been agreed
upon, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to focus on it more and steer the
discussion to try and deliver on the goal. Having open ended
discussions with no set goals sometimes is discouraging and sometimes
a waste of time.</p>

<p>To the point, I wanted to discuss some things not to say and do in a
meeting which might cause a collapse in communications, these are just
some things that I have noticed in the last few months worth of
meetings and are based on my own experiences,</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume you know everything, there will always be someone
smarter than you. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with being an expert in your
own area, but there are times where you just need to trust others to
deliver.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t pick on other team members for (possibly) not delivering, this
is hugely demoralising. It&#8217;s better to ask why, and if possible does
that team member or members need help to deliver.</li>
<li>In real life, does anyone really use waterfall methods to deliver a
project?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try and do micro-management if you are clearly middle or even
senior management, but at least describe tasks in the same language
as the stakeholder and developer so that things don&#8217;t get lost in
translation.</li>
<li>Do have a plan if the series of meetings are to last a few months if
there are long term goals to be achieved. If it&#8217;s not a plan, then
at least have a list of todo, work in progress and done tasks.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assign tasks without deadlines (realistic ones).</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume you are on the same page in discussions unless you are
confident that everyone at the meeting has common language and
understands what is being discussed. People come and go, so you just
have to be aware.</li>
</ul>


<p>Most if not all of the above list of things is common sense, there
isn&#8217;t anything too special that you need to do to succeed at
communicating.</p>

<id>http://jcftang.github.com/blog/2012/02/19/scientific-linux-6-dot-2-is-out</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SL6.2 has been out for a few days now, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to
really take a look at it, since the more recent SL6 installs I
maintain tend to be tracking the 6x releases. Hopefully SL will try
and keep inline with the upstreams support schedule.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve a personal preference for deploying SL over CentOS (or any other
recompiles of RHEL). SL tends to be a bit more polished in terms of
not breaking older installs, i.e. the upstream doesn&#8217;t move point
releases around as CentOS does, SL does not force the end user to run
the latest stable or continually upgrade to the latest point release
to get updates (due to the weird convention CentOS seems to have with
their archives).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s out, I need to look at it again, especially since ZFS is getting
closer to being ready for a bit more general usage on the server side
and the project that I am working will be needing some machines to be
installed and setup soon.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the time of writing it seems that the Raspberry Pi site is down,
probably suffering from a slashdot effect. I would imagine almost
every nerd, sheevaplug developer, OLPC developer, DIY&#8217;ers who want to
build their own home media centres are looking to get a Raspberry Pi
right now.</p>

<p>So what would I use one of these mini-computers for? I can think up a
range of cool applications for this device, assuming I can order a few
of these to play with. I&#8217;ve got ideas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Tahoe-LAFS storage node, I could attach a few HDD&#8217;s to one of these
devices and run Tahoe-LAFS on it, these computers are cheap enough
and have a low enough power consumption that I could just have them
on all the time.</li>
<li>A Babeld node, I could have a few of these devices dotted around my
house/apartment to build a mesh network.</li>
<li>A portable computer, not quite a tablet PC with a screen, but it has
enough connectivity to wire it up to a modern monitor or a TV.</li>
<li>A penetration testing device, just wire it up with a few DC
batteries, plug in a wireless card, wrap it up in a water proof
package. Power on, and see how far you can throw it at your target,
I can see endless possibilities for this device for pen-testing.</li>
</ul>


<p>I wonder if the device will ever be able to be powered via the USB
port or the the ethernet port. I can see some interesting uses for
this device in data centres for monitoring the network, power
consumption and a host of other things.</p>
