      <description>A co-worker of mine (Paddy Doyle) had originally hacked at a perl script for reporting balances from SLURM&amp;rsquo;s accounting system a year or two ago and he had figured out that it might be possible to do some minimalistic &amp;lsquo;configuration&amp;rsquo; and scripting to get a system that&amp;rsquo;s very basic but functional.
It was just one of those things that funding agencies wanted to justify how the system was being used, GOLD was clunky and obtrusive and complicated for what we wanted.</description>

      <description>This time the usergroup meeting is in BSC in Spain (this place is cool, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at BSC for a few conferences and meetings before). I wish I was doing some HPC right now, I&amp;rsquo;m very tempted to submit an abstract or two on the last two things with slurm that I was involved with.
The php-slurm package needs some love, its somewhat in use at work. I just wish I had more time to fix the memory leaks.</description>
