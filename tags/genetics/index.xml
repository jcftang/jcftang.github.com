      <description>In the past few months, in my spare time whenever I get a chance, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a side project in work. It&amp;rsquo;s a research project amongst a group of people with a cool idea. The idea is to apply neural networks to identifying diseases, populations and traits via machine learning/supervised learning. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure about the application of the technology as to how new or revolutionary it is, but it seems sensible that a machine is going to be very good at being taught how to recognise patterns so why not do it.</description>
