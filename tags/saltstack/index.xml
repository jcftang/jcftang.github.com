      <description>After going to SC13 and being at a few BoF&amp;rsquo;s and hearing some people talk about their operations and potentially using Salt to replace the likes of puppet and chef, I decided to learn a little more about Salt.
In particular since I have an old laptop lying around at home, I decided to setup a little private cloud. I followed this blog post.
It mostly worked apart from some buggy behaviour in the seeding process.</description>
